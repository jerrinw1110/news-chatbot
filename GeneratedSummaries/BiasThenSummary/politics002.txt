**Summary:**

Patricia Hewitt, the Trade and Industry Secretary, emphasized the need for extending paid maternity leave beyond the current six-month limit, labeling it a top priority for Labour's election manifesto. She discussed plans to evaluate the costs associated with extending maternity benefits while advocating for women's entry into male-dominated fields. Addressing sexism in the workplace, Hewitt stressed its impact on women's potential and earnings, with women earning 19% less than men. She stated, “Career sexism limits opportunities for women” and argued that stereotypes about job suitability hinder progress. Hewitt also pointed out that only about 10% of employees in engineering are women and that women tend to dominate lower-paid jobs. The government plans to fund initiatives to support women in various sectors and establish a pay experts panel led by the TUC to advise businesses on equal wage policies. Lastly, the article references a belief among many Britons that the gender pay gap stems from "natural differences" rather than systemic issues.
