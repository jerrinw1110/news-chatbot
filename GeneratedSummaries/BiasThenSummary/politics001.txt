**Summary:**

Prime Minister Tony Blair participated in a sailing trip with schoolchildren in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, to promote the Labour Party's education policies. Accompanied by Education Secretary Ruth Kelly, he emphasized the need for outdoor activities for children while addressing concerns from teachers about potential legal risks. Blair announced new guidelines to protect teachers from lawsuits tied to school outings. His education pledges, part of a six-point election plan, aim to improve school choice, introduce more specialist schools, create additional sixth-form places, enforce discipline through a zero-tolerance policy, and give head teachers more control over funding for handling disruptive students. The article highlights criticisms from the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties, which dismissed Blair's promises as insubstantial. The upcoming general election, anticipated on May 5, is prompting intensified campaigning from all parties, each proposing differing education strategies.
