Based on the content of the article, I would classify it as "center" in terms of media bias. 

The article presents the views and plans of the Conservative party (Tories) regarding immigration and asylum in the UK, specifically through the lens of Michael Howard's statements. It outlines the proposed reforms, the reasoning behind them, and includes criticisms from opposing political parties and organizations, such as Labour and refugee advocacy groups. The coverage demonstrates a balanced approach by including multiple perspectives on the issue: the Conservatives' argument that their plans are necessary to control immigration and enhance security, alongside critiques arguing that those plans could endanger genuine refugees and contravene international obligations.

The article does not exhibit strong bias toward either the left or right but instead reports on the political discourse surrounding asylum reform. This neutrality in reporting, along with the balanced views presented, suggests a centrist approach rather than siding with a particular political ideology.
