The Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas, is investigating the Cabinet Office's directive to delete emails older than three months, which he condemned as a potential attempt to circumvent the new Freedom of Information Act coming into effect on January 1. Thomas stated that only emails with "no current purpose" should be deleted, while emphasizing that destroying records to prevent disclosure could be deemed a criminal offense. This issue has drawn criticism from opposition leaders, including Tory leader Michael Howard and Lib Dem chairman Alan Beith, who raised concerns about the implications for important inquiries, like the Hutton Inquiry. Beith suggested that the timing of the directive, coinciding with the new legislation, seems too coincidental and urged the Information Commissioner to reassess the email retention policies to align with freedom of information laws. The Freedom of Information Act aims to grant public access to information from over 100,000 public bodies in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, with similar measures in Scotland.
