Patricia Hewitt, the Trade and Industry Secretary, emphasized the need to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months, suggesting this should be a focal point in Labour's election manifesto. She indicated that evaluating the cost of such a proposal is underway, highlighting that it is a priority shared across the government. Currently, mothers can take six months of paid leave, followed by six months unpaid. 

At a seminar organized by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC), Hewitt also stressed the need to combat "career sexism," which she believes hinders women's advancement in traditionally male-dominated fields. She announced initiatives aimed at assisting female graduates in science and engineering to connect with job opportunities and promoting "taster courses" in non-traditional professions for both genders. 

Noting that women earn 19% less than men in full-time roles, Hewitt stated that eliminating career sexism is essential to closing the gender pay gap, where women earn 80 pence to every pound earned by men in full-time work. The EOC's research shows widespread beliefs in "natural differences" causing the pay gap, while women occupy less than 10% of leadership roles in major sectors.
