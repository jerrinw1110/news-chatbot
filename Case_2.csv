17,This Administration Doesn’t Care About the Cool Girls,"GOP senators are already laying the groundwork with which to blow off the new, harrowing reporting from Jane Mayer in the New Yorker about Trump’s putative new defense secretary, Pete Hegseth. They dismiss the allegations of a serial abuser as the kind of sweetly innocent “wild child” activity that is somehow de rigueur in the military. Which means that many American women will yet again confront a tough choice: Are they going to be “party girls” or “not party girls,” as Hegseth himself allegedly classified the female staffers of the nonprofit veterans group he once ran? Do they wish to be the invisible, fungible women destined to be groped, assaulted, and humiliated, or will they be the “not party girls,” who, as we are only just beginning to discover, are invisible and fungible as well? This is hardly a new or unfamiliar taxonomy, just as the taxonomy of which women will die this year as a result of a miscarriage is not new or unfamiliar. No matter what we choose—to want to be mothers or not, to go along with it or not—it can still be any of us. As Nick Fuentes put it, women’s bodies are now his choice. So it can be any of us. The Republican senators who met with Hegseth this week brushed aside reports of drunkenness, sexual abuse, rape, and financial self-dealing as trivial, NBC reports, just as they threaten to do away with the very FBI background checks that would determine as much. So the victims will be any of us. We are finally collapsing the ancient social scaffolding of “good girls” versus “girls who had it coming” in the interest of ensuring that there are only girls who had it coming. It’s almost as if 2024 became the year in which maybe all women were not really … real. Jessica Reed Kraus, who writes the hugely popular House Inhabit Substack, affirmed after the election that she remains certain that Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and RFK Jr. were her leaders of choice. But she also noted that she is realizing that what women think of them doesn’t much matter to them. Reflecting on that photo of the bros pounding McDonald’s on Trump’s plane after a UFC match was, “even for me—someone who unapologetically champions the return of brazen masculinity— … a bit too ‘bro-ish’ for my liking.” Kraus couldn’t fathom why—having just wrapped up a “year’s worth of flattering coverage” of Trump—female Trump boosters, like herself and Danica Patrick, were again being shunted aside for the “podcast bros” her girlfriends weren’t tuned in to. Why, Kraus mused, in all this chest-thumping coverage of the UFC fight and the subsequent friends-with-that flight, had “no one honed in on the moment when Trump sidestepped a crowd to kiss Marla Maples on the cheek”? Kraus didn’t understand why women Trump fans had not been offered evidence of that kiss, like a chocolate-dipped Hallmark Christmas movie shot. As E.J. Dickson of the Cut noted, Kraus’ primary objection wasn’t so much the actual bro-y-ness of the postelection worldview as the bro-y “aesthetic.” Why, asked Kraus, is it that “the UFC scene was overwhelmingly directed to impress dudes”? Why, one must ponder, have all these public-facing men who pretended to care about their women and their families in 2016 opted to erase the media coverage of Trump’s sweet and loving kiss bestowed on the second wife with whom he cheated on the first wife, before he cheated on her by taking up with his third wife? What the hell, we are forced to ask, has happened to family values? It is certainly possible that the right-wing media simply forgot to cover the tender moments of fatherhood and love and heroic chivalry and sensitivity in this election cycle. But it is far more likely that the flagrant election of—and the subsequent offering of Cabinet positions to—a host of men variously accused of sexual assault, sexual trafficking of minors, assaulting babysitters, and serial adultery is no longer disqualifying for the position but essential and maybe even mandatory prior work experience. And so the performance of family values is a drag. Sherrilyn Ifill has been asking why discussions of gender and race have been almost totally erased from the postelection punditry, and embedded in that question is a more chilling one: Why have a host of men who manifestly hate women, who abuse and demean and then attempt to erase them, been offered leadership roles without a searching analysis of why that happened? Why did the patina of respect for, and the false promise of protection of, vulnerable women simply drop out of the Trump transition efforts? Is anyone experiencing the dawning realization that for men like Pete Hegseth—whose own mother has described him as a profoundly damaged abuser of women—the women who are grabbed and attacked and discredited are staunch Republican activists, not the other sorts of women, not the cat ladies, not the “non–party girls”? Is it possible, as Dickson describes it, that what “the growing reservations of female Trump voters indicate is that within the patriarchy, there are no exceptions, no chill girls to whom the rules do not apply”? The reason you are not seeing soft-filter narratives about Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks and their love for women is because there’s no need for filtration. Hating women is OK now. Any man who has been accused of wrongdoing is presumptively a gladiator, and any woman who levels an accusation is presumptively a liar. Jane Mayer’s stunning portrait of Hegseth’s life of abuse and assault, which includes paying off a victim of a 2017 assault in Monterey, ends with twin revelations that would be shocking in any other age: The Trump transition team didn’t bother to learn of and were in fact “blindsided” by these allegations. (Indeed, the group expected Hegseth to share them.) And Hegseth’s attorney told Mayer that the police report about the alleged sexual assault had surfaced prior false allegations of sexual assault by the alleged victim that had discredited her account. That was a lie, immediately debunked by the Monterey County district attorney’s office. No need to muddy the waters, no need to create alternative facts. Just call women liars and move along to the confirmation. For a very long time, we preferred to have public officials vetted before they assumed office—in part because of the fear that they could be subject to blackmail. Overnight and perhaps imperceptibly, we have moved into an era in which there is evidently no reason to fear such blackmail. The conduct shocks nobody. Abusing women for sport, or because you’re not a “church boy,” or because to be a “wild child” is to embody manliness: that need not be power-washed or kept secret anymore. There need be no investigation, FBI or ersatz, because whatever is unearthed is allowed. And the women who will be paid off and fired and shunned and rape kitted and lied about? They will be knowingly and deliberately devalued, whether they wanted to “party” or not.",SLATE,Left,1169,"Left  
The article critiques Republican senators for their dismissive attitudes towards allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse, portraying them as part of a broader societal failure to protect women. The tone is critical of right-wing politics and emphasizes gender issues, suggesting a progressive viewpoint that aligns with leftist values. It addresses the problematic nature of patriarchal norms and the consequences for women, reflecting a deep concern for social justice and equality which are characteristic of leftist media bias."

The article presents the Biden administration's initiatives on airline customer protections positively, emphasizing consumer welfare and regulatory enforcement. The focus on significant compensation for delays and transparency in airline practices reflects a progressive stance favoring consumer rights over corporate interests.

179,Democrats are urging Biden to cancel student debt for thousands of borrowers before Trump takes office,"A group of Democratic lawmakers want President Joe Biden to quickly process student-debt cancellation applications for thousands of borrowers before it's too late. On Wednesday, 75 Democratic lawmakers, led by Sens. Dick Durbin and Ed Markey and Rep. Maxine Waters, sent a letter to Education Sec. Miguel Cardona urging him to discharge unprocessed borrower defense applications, which are applications student-loan borrowers can submit if they believe they were defrauded by the school they attended. If approved, the loans they took out to attend that school would be discharged. With President-elect Donald Trump taking office in under two months, the lawmakers said debt relief would become a lot more uncertain under his leadership. ""We're here today to demand that the Department of Education deliver on President Biden's commitment to debt relief and process all outstanding borrower defense relier before President Trump slams the door shut on borrowers on January 20,"" Markey said during a Wednesday press conference. ""Borrowers who attended fraudulent schools and have struggled with debt for years or even decades cannot afford to wait any longer."" The lawmakers urged Biden during their press conference to cancel the loans of borrowers who applied for borrower defense in the next 50 days. In their letter, they added that the relief should include the thousands of borrowers already approved for relief who are still waiting for their balances to be wiped out. The lawmakers also wrote that the department should use its authority to enact group discharges for borrowers who attended schools ""with documented histories of predatory practices,"" along with processing any remaining applications. Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott also urged the Education Department in late November to approve student-debt relief applications not just for borrower defense but for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. During his first term, Trump proposed eliminating the program, which cancels any remaining debt for public sector workers after 10 years of qualifying payments. An Education Department spokesperson told Business Insider that the department ""remains committed to getting borrowers whose colleges took advantage of them all the relief they are entitled without further action on their part."" The spokesperson said that the department paused payments for borrowers with approved discharges and recommended that borrowers with questions on the status of their applications call the borrower defense hotline at 1-855-279-6207. Biden's Education Department has canceled student debt for nearly 5 million borrowers over the past years, including $28.7 billion for over 1.6 million borrowers who were defrauded by their schools. However, thousands of borrowers are still waiting for their borrower defense applications to be processed, and time is running out. Durbin said on the Senate floor on Monday that it's ""critical"" Biden discharge those borrowers' loans ""as quickly as possible"" because, under Trump's first term, his Education Department ran up a backlog of borrower defense claims, leaving impacted borrowers waiting years for relief. ""History shows that a second Trump Administration is likely to do everything in its power to prevent these students from receiving relief again,"" Durbin said on Monday. ""But our nation's students, who are simply trying to better their lives deserve better."" Trump has not yet provided details on how he will approach student-loan forgiveness. However, some higher education experts previously told Business Insider that relief would likely not be his priority. Preston Cooper, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said that Trump would likely ""take a bit more of a skeptical attitude"" with borrower defense applications because the Education Department can determine if a borrower qualifies. ""If it's a loan cancellation program that leaves a lot more discretion up to the Department of Education, we could certainly see some major swings in policy,"" Cooper said.",BusinessInsider,Lean Left,610,"Left  
The article strongly highlights the actions and demands of Democratic lawmakers concerning student debt cancellation, emphasizing the urgency of these actions before Trump's presidency. It presents a clear alignment with Democratic viewpoints while criticizing Trump's potential stance on debt relief, showcasing a bias favoring left-leaning perspectives and policies on education and student assistance. This framing and focus on Democratic efforts to advocate for borrowers underscores the article's left-leaning bias."
88,Republicans Must Defend Matt Gaetz To End The Use Of Salacious Lies As A Political Weapon,"Before marrying in 2021, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., was known to be a braggadocious libertine. No conservative wants to defend such behavior, and so many on the Right are remaining silent as Gaetz is accused of also engaging in criminal conduct, paying prostitutes, and having sex with a minor. The claims against Gaetz are but another information operation, however, mirroring the ones that previously targeted Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh. And this pattern will continue unabated unless Americans unflinchingly condemn the tactic — no matter the target. We should have learned this lesson from Donald Trump’s first presidential run and time in office. From Crossfire Hurricane, to the pee-tape dossier, to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, unsupported and unbelievable accusations leaked to the public hampered Trump’s ability to advance his agenda. Time and again the charges proved unfounded, and yet in advance of the 2024 election, the lawfare continued. The country, however, had wised up by then and recognized the various criminal and civil charges leveled against Trump for what they were: an effort to interfere in the election. Why then is anyone giving credence to the accusations against Gaetz, especially given the FBI — after thoroughly investigating the matter for two years — decided not to charge Gaetz? Rather, career prosecutors for the Department of Justice concluded there were credibility problems with “the two central witnesses” to the case. Earlier this week, The Federalist’s editor-in-chief, Mollie Hemingway, detailed not just the DOJ’s conclusion that the women’s stories would be unconvincing to a jury, but the many additional problems with the entire hoax. Take, for instance, the fact that a jail-house informant revealed that his cellmate, Joel Greenberg, was behind the woman’s claims that she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17. And Greenberg himself had admitted to “fabricating allegations against a schoolteacher who was running against him to be a tax collector,” with Greenberg sending “letters to the school falsely claiming the teacher had an inappropriate sexual relationship with a student.” Yet now that Trump has nominated Gaetz to serve as his attorney general, opponents to the former Florida representative are dusting off the sex trafficking claims. On Friday, ABC News ran an interview with the lawyer who represents two women who testified before the House Ethics Committee about Gaetz’s supposed misconduct. According to ABC News, those two witnesses had previously testified as part of the DOJ investigation. So, the very same witnesses the FBI — which holds no love lost for Gaetz — concluded lack credibility are the impetus for the House Ethics Committee investigation. Now, the media and some senators are pressuring the House Ethics Committee to release their report on the investigation into Gaetz. Whether that happens or not, though, there will surely be leaks designed to doom Gaetz’s nomination as attorney general. While some on the Right may prefer not to defend the former playboy, the only way to end the growing use of salacious lies as a political weapon is to condemn the information operation, prosecute those responsible, and ostracize the members of the media responsible for advancing the hoax. Like it or not, that’s precisely what conservatives must do in response to the attacks on Gaetz. Had Republicans adopted this approach when the Left came for the blemishless Brett Kavanaugh, it wouldn’t need to defend Gaetz against the false accusations now. But whether Gaetz’s bachelorhood looked vastly different than Kavanaugh is of no moment: What matters is that the enemies of both men used lies to manipulate politics. And our Republic cannot allow that tactic to stand.",Federalist,Right,596,"Lean Right  
This article exhibits a lean right bias as it supports Republican Matt Gaetz amid accusations against him. It characterizes the allegations as politically motivated attacks similar to those against Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, emphasizing a narrative of victimization of conservatives. The use of terms like ""hoax"" and ""salacious lies"" reflects a defensive posture typical of right-leaning rhetoric while urging Republicans to rally around Gaetz, which aligns with the broader conservative media tendency to dismiss negative portrayals of allies."
65,"Who was Brian Thompson, slain CEO of UnitedHealthcare?","For 20 years Brian Thompson, the healthcare executive killed in a Manhattan shooting on Wednesday, climbed to the top of UnitedHealthcare. The 50-year-old chief executive of the main division of the conglomerate UnitedHealth Group, the US’s largest health insurer, was gunned down in midtown Manhattan on Wednesday morning by a masked assailant in what police are calling a “brazen targeted attack.” An alumnus of the University of Iowa, Thompson joined the company in 2004 from accountancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers. He was named chief executive officer for UnitedHealthcare in April 2021 after serving in several other roles, most recently as chief executive officer of UnitedHealthcare’s government programs business. UnitedHealth Group is the fourth-largest public company in the US behind Walmart, Amazon and Apple. A father of two, Thompson lived in a suburb of Minneapolis, about a 20-minute drive from the company’s headquarters. His wife, Paulette Thompson, told NBC News that her husband had been receiving threats. “There had been some threats,” she said. “I don’t know details. I just know that he said there were some people that had been threatening him.” She said police had told her the shooting was “a planned attack”. “He was a good person and I am so sad,” Elena Reveiz, Thompson’s sister-in-law, told the New York Times. Thompson, who managed a division employing about 140,000 people, had been attending the company’s investor conference at the Hilton Hotel in midtown Manhattan. He was shot outside the hotel and died later in hospital. Police are still searching for his killer. “We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare,” the company said in a statement. The firm added: “Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him. We are working closely with the New York police department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian’s family and all who were close to him.”",TheGuardiadn,Left,331,"Center

209,Democratic Lawmakers From Connecticut Report Bomb Threats Against Their Homes,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — At least six Democratic members of Congress from Connecticut were targeted by bomb threats on their homes Thursday, the lawmakers or their offices said. Sen. Chris Murphy and all five House members — Reps. Jim Himes, Joe Courtney, John Larson, Jahana Hayes and Rosa DeLauro — reported being the subject of such threats. Police who responded said they found no evidence of explosives on the lawmakers' properties. There was no immediate word whether Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal also received a threat. The bomb threats against Democrats happened a day after a number of President-elect Donald Trump ’s most prominent Cabinet picks and appointees reported that they had received such threats, as well as “swatting attacks,"" in which perpetrators initiate an emergency law enforcement response against a victim under false pretenses. Murphy's office said his Hartford home was the target of a bomb threat, “which appears to be part of a coordinated effort involving multiple members of Congress and public figures.” Hartford Police and U.S. Capitol Police determined there was no threat. DeLauro said in a Thursday evening post on X that the New Haven Police Department's bomb squad responded to the threat and “determined no bomb was present at our home. I am thankful for their swift response & relieved no one was harmed.” Hayes said the Wolcott Police Department informed her Thursday morning that it had received “a threatening email stating a pipe bomb had been placed in the mailbox at my home.” State police, U.S. Capitol Police, and the House sergeant at arms were notified, Wolcott and state police responded “and no bomb or explosive materials were discovered.” Courtney's Vernon home received a bomb threat while his wife and children were there, his office said. Himes said he was told of the threat against his home during a Thanksgiving celebration with his family. The U.S. Capitol Police, and Greenwich and Stamford police departments responded. Hines extended his family's “utmost gratitude to our local law enforcement officers for their immediate action to ensure our safety.” Echoing other lawmakers who were threatened, he added: “There is no place for political violence in this country, and I hope that we may all continue through the holiday season with peace and civility.” Larson also said Thursday that East Hartford Police responded to a bomb threat against his home. The FBI declined to give details on the latest episodes except to say it is investigating them in partnership with other agencies. The threats follow an election season marked by violence. In July, a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing him in the ear and killing one of his supporters. The Secret Service later thwarted a subsequent assassination attempt at Trump’s West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course when an agent spotted the barrel of a gun poking through a perimeter fence while Trump was golfing. Among those who received threats Wednesday were New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, Trump’s pick to serve as the next ambassador to the United Nations; Matt Gaetz, Trump’s initial pick to serve as attorney general; Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, whom Trump chose to lead the Department of Labor, and former New York congressman Lee Zeldin, who has been tapped to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.",TIME,Lean Left,545,"Center

69,House Democrat Trashes Trump’s Cabinet Picks With Brutal Made-For-TV Dig,"Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) scorched Donald Trump for wanting to make his Cabinet a “junk drawer” on Wednesday as he slammed the president-elect over his picks for top government roles in a speech on the House floor. “I mean, it looks like the requirements to be in the Trump White House that you either abuse women or you’re an out-of-touch billionaire,” said McGovern, who has previously called Trump’s picks “beyond insane.” “What’s next?” he added. “Are they going to replace FBI background checks with a Fox News screen test?” McGovern knocked Trump for picking several men accused of sexual misconduct to join his administration including former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, Trump’s choice to serve as defense secretary who he is reportedly considering replacing with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) amid spiraling controversy. “I mean, this guy is probably dropping out momentarily. Apparently, he drinks on the job and paid to cover up his sexual assault allegations. Even his mom doesn’t like him,” McGovern said of Hegseth and his mother’s damning 2018 criticism which she has since walked back. McGovern, earlier in his remarks, scolded House Republicans for having their “priorities” all “screwed up.” “I mean, they’re talking about what bathrooms people should use instead of talking about grocery prices,” said McGovern as he criticized Rep. Nancy Mace (R-N.C.) for reportedly making hundreds of social media posts regarding her anti-trans bathroom crusade in 72 hours. He declared that the GOP wants politicians to “stop catering to those at the top.” He then added, “Yet look at who Donald Trump is empowering in his new administration.” McGovern later sarcastically called it a “big surprise” that Trump named Howard Lutnick, billionaire CEO of investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald and co-chair of his transition team, to be his commerce secretary pick. “I don’t think this guy is capable of understanding what average people in my district deal with,” McGovern said. “His education secretary,” he continued. “Yet another billionaire. What’s her qualification? She ran WWE. I guess some schools have wrestling programs. It would be funny if it weren’t so sad.”",Huffpost,Left,346,"Left  
The article presents a strong negative portrayal of Donald Trump's Cabinet picks through harsh criticisms and accusations from Rep. Jim McGovern. The language used is charged and emphasizes a progressive perspective, criticizing Trump's choices for being wealthy and out of touch while calling out alleged sexual misconduct. Such framing aligns with a left-leaning media bias that often seeks to highlight social justice issues and critique conservative policies and figures."
169,'I pulled him out': Trump pushes back on DEA pick saying he withdrew,"President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday that he had pulled his pick to lead the Drug Enforcement Agency despite Hillsborough County, Florida, Sheriff Chad Chronister saying the day before he was withdrawing from consideration. Trump said Wednesday on his Truth Social platform that Chronister ""didn’t pull out, I pulled him out, because I did not like what he said to my pastors and other supporters,"" taking offense to a Wall Street Journal headline that called the move ""a setback."" Although Trump touted Chronister and said he would work to ""stop the flow of Fentanyl, and other Illegal Drugs,"" in announcing his selection, there was pushback against Chronister from conservatives for his enforcement of COVID-19 lockdowns during the pandemic. Many prominent conservatives criticized Chronister for arresting a pastor who defied lockdown orders and held a service during the pandemic. On Tuesday, Chronister announced he was withdrawing from the position, which needs Senate approval, saying in a post on X that there was ""more work to be done for the citizens"" of his county. ""To have been nominated by President-Elect @realDonaldTrump to serve as Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration is the honor of a lifetime. Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I’ve concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration,"" he said in his post. The sheriff did not mention the conservative backlash, but many of those who opposed Trump's selection immediately applauded his decision to withdraw. ""Glad to see him withdraw from consideration. Next time politicians lose their ever-lovin minds, he can redeem himself by following the Constitution,"" Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., posted on X on Tuesday.",ABC,Lean Left,275,"Lean Right

106,"Sen. Ernst, Elon, Vivek Target Federal Telework Abuses in 1st DOGE Caucus: Bureaucrats in ‘Bubble Baths’ on ‘Taxpayers’ Dime’","Federal bureaucrats are costing taxpayers billions while dodging office responsibilities, including reports of teleworking employees attending meetings from “on the beach” and while “relaxing in bubble baths,” according to a year-long investigation by Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, unveiled at the inaugural Senate DOGE Caucus meeting alongside Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, both of whom were tasked by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) is making waves today owing to the first meeting of the Senate DOGE Caucus, with the disclosure of her scathing report on federal government inefficiency and telework abuse. Inside the Pete Hegseth Confirmation Battle with Matt Boyle The report, part of her ongoing campaign against bureaucratic waste, highlights how federal employees are neglecting responsibilities, while taxpayers foot the bill for empty office buildings and unsupervised remote work. “Bureaucrats are playing hide-and-seek,” Ernst declared. In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News, Sen. Ernst highlighted the urgency of restoring accountability in federal agencies. “For years, I have been tracking down bureaucrats relaxing in bubble baths, playing golf, getting arrested, and doing just about everything besides their job,” she stated. “It would almost be funny if it wasn’t happening on the taxpayers’ dime and at the expense of veterans, seniors, small business owners, and Americans in need of competent service from government agencies.” “Federal employees need to return to work, but if they don’t want to, I will make their wish come true,” she added. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), co-lead by prominent entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, aims to hold federal employees accountable, curb unnecessary spending, and streamline federal operations by cutting waste, reducing bureaucracy, and slashing regulations as part of Trump’s “Save America” agenda. Ernst’s investigation, spanning a year and a half, uncovers startling statistics: Federal telework surged from 3% pre-pandemic to nearly 30% of employees now working entirely remotely. Office space utilization in Washington averages just 12%, with billions spent annually on maintenance, energy, and unused furnishings. Public services suffer, as veterans’ calls for mental health care go unanswered and crucial baby formula safety warnings are delayed due to staffing gaps. The findings call attention to instances of paycheck fraud, with teleworking employees claiming inflated locality pay by living far from their assigned offices. Some employees, Ernst found, were logging in from over 2,000 miles away while collecting higher salaries meant for workers in more expensive regions. The Iowa Senator proposed several measures to reform the bloated federal bureaucracy that burdens taxpayers: Relocating federal offices to areas better aligned with their missions, cutting costs and increasing accountability. Selling off unused office space, including over 7,000 vacant government buildings. Implementing stricter telework policies, tracking employee performance and location with modern tools like VPN logins and office swipe-ins. Ensuring telework agreements prioritize taxpayer needs over convenience for government employees. Sen. Ernst has long advocated for cutting federal waste while ensuring government accountability. Last year, she urged the relocation of taxpayer-funded government buildings from President Joe Biden’s “D.C. swamp” to the “heartland” — where they can be “more accountable to the hardworking Americans” there. Her Government Accountability Office (GAO) report revealed that most federal offices are largely vacant due to widespread teleworking among federal employees. She also successfully introduced a bill amendment reducing pay for bureaucrats based on their telework extent and remote work locations. She also demanded a probe into remote work’s impact on productivity earlier in September. Previously, she announced a reform package in an effort to hold the “entrenched federal bureaucracy” accountable, “drain the swamp,” and “cut red tape.” The package of solutions includes bringing decision-making “closer to the American people and mak[ing] government responsive to the real needs of Americans” through the SWAMP Act she introduced. Through support for the Stopping Home Office Work’s Unproductive Problems (SHOW UP) Act, she is also seeking to require federal bureaucrats “‘teleworking’ on the taxpayer’s dime” to “show up for work,” demanding investigations into their “abuse” of remote “work.” Ernst has also called for the closure of the recently renovated Nancy Pelosi Federal Building in Democrat-run San Francisco, citing severe public safety concerns from a spike in crime and drug activity in the area and describing the “haunted house” as a “far-left failure” and “symbol” of government dysfunction. The unsafe conditions, highlighted by an alarming number of overdoses and violent incidents near the facility, led the Department of Health and Human Services to advise employees against coming to the office. With recent elections ushering in a Republican majority, she is now urging the incoming Republican-controlled Congress to prioritize and pass her proposed legislation to eliminate waste, downsize bureaucracy, and hold federal agencies accountable.

It showcases Republican Senator Joni Ernst's efforts to reform federal operations and includes supportive statements from prominent right-leaning figures like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. The framing of government workers as irresponsible and the emphasis on accountability resonate with a right-wing narrative that prioritizes fiscal conservatism and reduction of government size.

38,Missouri voters enshrined abortion rights. GOP lawmakers are already working to roll them back,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. One month after Missouri voters approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to abortion, Republican lawmakers in the deeply red state are already working to overturn it — or at least undermine it. One measure would ask voters to amend the state constitution to define life as beginning at conception, declaring that embryos are people with rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The result would be to classify abortion as an unlawful killing. Another proposal, aimed at repealing the abortion rights amendment, would ask voters to ban gender transition procedures for minors, tying the two issues together, despite the fact that the amendment did not address gender surgery and gender-affirming care for transgender children is already illegal in Missouri. Other proposed amendments include stricter abortion limits, such as restricting access to cases of rape, incest, medical emergencies and fetal anomalies. These measures would impose additional requirements, such as mandating that rape survivors file police reports to obtain an abortion. GOP lawmakers have also introduced a measure to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution through voter initiatives, which could make it harder to pass similar measures in the future. The legislative moves follow the Nov. 5 election, in which the amendment to put abortion rights in the state constitution won by a 51.6%-48.4% margin. Starting Thursday, the right to abortion will be constitutionally guaranteed up to the point of fetal viability, while restrictions on post-viability abortions will remain in place. In other states where voters approved abortion rights measures last month, there were no signs yet that lawmakers would also try to counter those measures. Even before votes in Missouri had been counted, proponents of Amendment 3, as the measure was called, had anticipated that a victory would be met with efforts to somehow undercut abortion rights. “These people will continue to rail against abortion,” said state Rep. Deb Lavender, a Democrat from the St. Louis suburbs. Although Missouri already has a law recognizing life as beginning at conception, stating that unborn children have “protectable interests in life, health, and well-being,” the proposed constitutional amendment would go further. It would effectively elevate this principle to the state constitution and potentially complicate not only abortion rights but the legality of in vitro fertilization and the handling of embryos. Several states have laws recognizing fetal personhood, but Missouri would be the second — after Alabama — to enshrine it in its constitution. That could create legal and ideological confusion or even conflicts, experts say. “You could see voters saying, ‘I support a right to abortion,’ but also saying, ‘Life begins at conception,’ without understanding that you can’t have both of those things at the same time,” said Jamille Fields Allsbrook, a professor at St. Louis University School of Law and a former policy analyst for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The author of one of the personhood measures, Rep. Justin Sparks, a Republican from the St. Louis suburbs, said he was emboldened by the narrow margin of the abortion rights vote. “A clear mandate has not been achieved,” he said. While the amendment had strong support in metro St. Louis and Kansas City and in the county that’s home to the University of Missouri, “the vast majority of the rest of the state voted in a different direction,” he added. “So I think it’s fair to again bring the question up.” But state Sen. Tracy McCreery, a Democrat also from the St. Louis suburbs, noted that Sparks was going against the will of voters in the St. Louis area. “I find that even more disrespectful of the voters,” she said. “It wasn’t just voters that tend to vote Democratic that voted yes on Amendment 3. It was also Republican voters and independent voters, and I think that’s getting lost in this discussion.” The measure to link abortion and transgender rights reflects the campaign before the election, when abortion opponents conflated these topics. Critics said this strategy seeks to distract from abortion rights, which had strong voter support, by capitalizing on voter discomfort with transgender issues. While GOP lawmakers push these measures, the legal landscape around abortion in Missouri is already shifting. On Wednesday, a Jackson County Circuit Court heard arguments in a lawsuit brought by Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri that seeks to strike down Missouri’s near-total abortion ban and other laws that regulate abortion. The lawsuit followed the passage of Amendment 3. Planned Parenthood said if it wins in court it plans to resume abortion services in St. Louis, Kansas City and Columbia on Friday. Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey has acknowledged that the amendment will legalize most abortions when it goes into effect, but he has said he intends to enforce remaining restrictions, such as a ban on abortions after fetal viability, a 72-hour waiting period and parental consent for minors. Lawmakers are also pushing to raise the bar for passing constitutional amendments. Now, a simple majority is enough; that has allowed Missouri voters to bypass the legislature and pass progressive amendments that lawmakers oppose. A new bill would ask voters to pass a constitutional amendment requiring not just a statewide majority but also a majority of voters in five of the state’s eight congressional districts — a change critics argued would give disproportionate power to rural areas over urban voters. It would then be harder for voters to approve measures that don’t align with the priorities of the conservative politicians they tend to elect. Earlier this year, a similar effort to make it harder to amend the constitution failed after Democrats in the Senate filibustered it. Sparks criticized the Republican leadership in the General Assembly for allowing the failure, pointing to a Republican supermajority in both houses that could have passed the measure. “We hold all the power,” Sparks said. “We hold all the procedural levers of power, and we can shut down debate in both houses any time, any day, for any bill we choose to.” Florida shows how a higher threshold for voter initiatives might play out. In 2006, the state raised the bar for constitutional amendments to 60%. This year, a majority of voters — 57% — supported an abortion rights amendment, an even bigger margin than in Missouri, but not sufficient in Florida. It’s not clear yet, though, whether any of the measures have enough support in Missouri’s General Assembly. Lavender said that the campaign supporting abortion rights significantly outraised its opposition during the election. “It’s going to be difficult to overturn,” she said. “You’ll have the same money that supported it now going up against you.”",AlterNet,Left,1124,"Left  
This article emphasizes the efforts of Republican lawmakers to undermine newly established abortion rights in Missouri, portraying them in a negative light. It highlights the implications of proposed measures and quotes Democratic representatives who criticize the GOP's actions, which aligns with a left-leaning perspective on reproductive rights. The focus on protecting abortion rights and highlighting opposition to conservative initiatives further reinforces this classification."
187,The Opposition to Trump Has Never Been This Deflated,"This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. Around this time eight years ago, a whole lot of time went into cobbling together what would come to be known as The Resistance. As the country—and the world, really—started to come to understand the incoming Trump administration’s plans, an unlikely cooperative of folks—feminists, scientists, immigration activists, traditional Republicans—found common ground in their shared sense of dread. On the first full day of Donald Trump’s presidency, the amalgam responded with a national day of protest that, to that point, had no peer. Now, facing a second wave of Trumpism, that collective urgency seems rather muted. Pink hats are not the must-have accessory this season. Community organizing remains potent but hardly trendy. The intersectionality that brought together those most worried about how Trump might undermine women’s rights, enact a potential Muslim ban, or decimate America’s global standing has never looked so thin. The news on Monday that Special Counsel Jack Smith was dropping both of his federal cases against Trump merited little more than a shrug. Trump’s detractors aren’t planning to meet his second inauguration on Jan. 20 with silence, but the overall response might be duller this time. The Women’s March is going to rally supporters on Jan. 18 in Washington. The Rev. Al Sharpton is planning his own rally to compete with Trump’s Inauguration. Yet it’s tough to imagine any counter-programming making as big a splash—or much of a dent against what feels to many like an unavoidable Trumpian tide. There is, in a sense, a thud of pervasive inevitability around Trump’s return among those who were previously most vocal in trying to stop him. The lack of enthusiasm has been one of the most under-appreciated aspects of the most recent campaign. As TIME’s Charlotte Alter dubbed it back in March—March!—this was The Dread Election. President Joe Biden’s midsummer meltdown and hasty halt of his re-nomination did little to remedy that, although the surge in interest in Kamala Harris’ elevation gave Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans reason to hope. Still, by the time Election Day got here, there was a collective eagerness just to know how it would end. Trump, as we all know, prevailed—improving his standing across most demographics in a squeaker of a win in the popular vote closer than almost anything seen since the 19th Century. Democratic machinations are ongoing as the party elites and rank-and-file members alike puzzle the path forward, and the rest of us are just watching. The incoming Republican regime will be in charge for the next four years, with narrow control of Congress for at least the first two of those. The listless resignation among Trump’s detractors is not just your imagination, either. Polling released by Pew at the end of last week finds a majority of the country is, by and large, ready for Trump 2.0. About half of Americans—53%—say they approve of the President-elect’s plans, with a smaller 46% opposing them, according to Pew polling. While just 41% of Americans think Trump can bring the nation together and 45% say they trust him on abortion policy, he compensates by posting 59% ratings on the economy and 53% on immigration. A paltry 42% of Americans think of him as honest, 37% see him as even-tempered, and 34% see him as a role model. Put plainly: Americans don’t necessarily like Trump, but they’re going to give him the benefit of the doubt, at least for now, when it comes to the hard-power duties of the presidency. A full 68% of Americans told Pew they were not surprised by Trump’s win, including 58% of Democrats. The numbers also show a softening of ill-will toward him. After his 2016 victory, just 36% of Americans said they had warm feelings toward him. That number slipped to 34% after his 2020 loss. These days, that’s up to a warmer 43%, according to the Pew modeling. Separately, a Morning Consult poll found roughly one-third (32%) of voters using “exhausted” to precisely describe their mood after Trump’s win. Among women—the engine behind most recent protests against Trump—that number hits 38%. Among Democrats, the number tops 54%. All of which explains why the fire behind The Resistance is a little less searing right now, even as Trump promises to push his agenda more aggressively than he did the first time around. While groups like Democracy Forward, Public Citizen, and Indivisible still are working to stand in the breach, fatigue is real. Good-government groups like the Partnership For Public Service are trying to hold onto norms and standards, but it can at times feel folly given Trump’s incoming roster of transgressive talents. Admittedly, this post-election period is a beige moment in politics. The worst threats of the election season were dodged; protests in the streets never materialized, violent disputes over ballots did not happen, denialism gave way to facts. In this transitional period, it’s tough to spark and then sustain the urgency of eight years ago—especially given the country has seen how Trump obliterates norms, follows through on campaign threats, and breaks his opposition without many regards for consequences. Among those millions of Americans bracing for all that to unfold, most are just too tired to summon the outrage again. Make sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C.

225,New progressive chair: Democrats must refocus on workers and wages to combat Trump's culture wars,"WASHINGTON — The Democratic Party messed up in the 2024 election, says Rep. Greg Casar of Texas, the newly elected chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and it needs a dramatic course shift to rediscover its brand and put winning “above being right.” In a wide-ranging interview with NBC News on Wednesday, one day before he was officially elected as chair, Casar laid out his vision for the future, saying that Democrats need to return to their roots as the party of the working class. That means welcoming voters who disagree with the left on cultural issues and not being “seen as preachy or disconnected.” In the wake of a devastating defeat to President-elect Donald Trump that Casar insists was avoidable, the congressman said Democrats must refocus their core identity on helping workers and increasing wages — but do so “without throwing vulnerable people under the bus.” He rejected the view that Democrats need to turn against immigrants or transgender people after Trump campaigned heavily on those issues in his victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. Instead, Casar said Democrats should change course by redirecting such attacks and accusing the GOP of fueling culture wars to district voters from their agenda of helping the rich get richer. “The progressive movement needs to change. We need to re-emphasize core economic issues every time some of these cultural war issues are brought up,” Casar said. “So when we hear Republicans attacking queer Americans again, I think the progressive response needs to be that a trans person didn’t deny your health insurance claim, a big corporation did — with Republican help. We need to connect the dots for people that the Republican Party obsession with these culture war issues is driven by Republicans’ desire to distract voters and have them look away while Republicans pick their pocket.” That means the Democratic Party needs to “shed off some of its more corporate elements,” to sharpen the economic-populist contrast with Republicans and not let voters equate the two parties, he said. He predicted Trump and the Republican-led Congress will offer plenty of opportunities to drive that distinction, including when it pursues an extension of tax cuts for upper earners. “The core of the Republican Party is about helping Wall Street and billionaires. And I think we have to call out the game,” Casar said. “The Democratic Party, at its best, can hold people or can have inside of its tent people across geography, across race and across ideology. Because we’re all in the same boat when it comes to making sure that you can retire with dignity, that your kids can go to school, that you can buy a house.” Casar, 35, from Austin, ran unopposed for progressive chair to take the reins from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who is term-limited. It’s a rapid rise for the native Texan and son of immigrants from Mexico, who was a labor organizer and Austin City Council member before winning his second term in the House last month. Casar's remarks add to an intense debate within the Democratic Party in which some blame Harris’ defeat on the excesses of the left, imposing social litmus tests that alienated large swaths of working-class voters. Harris was dogged by some stances she took in her first run for president in 2019, most notably her endorsement of gender-affirming care for inmates, including those in the country illegally, paid by taxpayers, which Trump used to depict her as disconnected from ordinary Americans. Casar believes the median voter stands to the left of the Democratic Party’s mainstream on economic issues, and he admitted that, at least today, the median voter is more culturally conservative than his party. He said the solution is to lead without getting too far ahead of where that voter is on social issues. “I think we should lead the country, but we should never be more than an arm’s length ahead,” Casar said. “If we get more than a couple arms lengths ahead of the country, then you’re vulnerable to attacks from the Republicans.” He said it could be fixed by refashioning the party’s image toward the kitchen-table needs that keep average voters up at night. “It’s less of a left-right fight and more of a getting back to a Democratic Party that’s for everyday people, no longer being seen as preachy or disconnected,” Casar said. Reflecting on the 2024 election, Casar attributed Harris’ loss less to her campaign and more to “where our entire Democratic Party brand has wound up.” He also said President Joe Biden clearly erred in deciding to run for re-election (the president dropped out under pressure in July after a disastrous debate performance). “I think that it was clear that President Biden needed to step down,” Casar said. “Some people felt a level of loyalty to the president for his work. And I think that comes from a good place. But we can’t lose. ... We are now at a place where we have to put winning way above being right all the time.” “Coming from Texas, I know what the cost is of losing,” he said.",NBC,Lean Left,852,"Left  
The article reflects a progressive perspective, emphasizing the need for the Democratic Party to refocus on economic issues and the working class while critiquing Republicans for cultural distractions.

94,Blockbuster: Trump Appoints RFK Jr to Head Health & Human Services,"When Robert.F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the 2024 presidential race in August, he immediately went to a Trump rally, and before an amazed and enthusiatic throng of MAGA supporters, endorsed the former president. Today, Kennedy was rewarded as Trump chose him to oversee the powerful Department of Health and Human Services. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health."" The president-elect added, “The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country.” Kennedy's slogan during the campaign was ""Make America Healthy Again,"" a spinoff from the MAGA acronym. The son of Robert Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy, RFK Jr. built a career as an environmental attorney, suing chemical corporations and large pharmaceutical companies. Kennedy became one of the foremost figures in 2020 who were sounding the alarm against the dangers of COVID vaccines and what many saw as a media coverup of vaccine injuries. At a town hall event last month, Kennedy stated, “I think most people don’t know what my stance is on vaccines. I’ve never been anti-vaccine. And I’ve said that hundreds and hundreds of times, but it doesn’t matter, because that is a way of silencing me.” Democrats in Washington and public health officials reacted negatively to the appointment. According to Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, “Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is not remotely qualified for the role and should be nowhere near the science-based agencies that safeguard our nutrition, food safety, and health."" However, Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) posted on X, “Finally, someone to detox the place after the Fauci era.” Many pro-life supporters may put up at least a yellow flag, if not a red flag, to the Kennedy appointment, since he's been given authority over government agencies that involve abortions, which Kennedy supports. The pro-life camp watched with consternation as Trump seemed to back off of the solidly pro-life position from his first term. The president-elect made two other appointments late Thursday, nominating North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum as Secretary of the Interior and former Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force reserve command, over the Department of Veterans Affairs. ""Doug is a Veteran himself, who currently serves our Nation as a Chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve Command, and fought for our Country in the Iraq War,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""We must take care of our brave men and women in uniform, and Doug will be a great advocate for our Active Duty Servicemembers, Veterans, and Military Families to ensure they have the support they need. Thank you, Doug, for your willingness to serve our country in this very important role."" Former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz Tapped As America's Top Prosecutor Controversy is still swirling around Trump's nomination of former Florida Republican congressman Matt Gaetz as the U.S. Attorney General. Many Senate Republicans doubt he'll get enough votes to be confirmed amid questions about sexual misconduct allegations. Democratic Senators are asking the House Ethics Committee to turn over its report on Gaetz which was about to be released before he resigned from Congress after Mr. Trump announced his nomination. ""I'm calling on the House Ethics Committee to preserve and share their report and all relevant documentation of Mr. Gaetz with the Senate Judiciary Committee,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-IL. Others are criticizing the former Florida congressman saying he lacks both the experience and moral compass to lead the Justice Department. ""President-elect Donald Trump has quickly named many good choices to serve in his cabinet. But Matt Gaetz is not one of them,"" said Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver. ""Matt Gaetz has neither the experience nor the moral character to serve as the highest law enforcement officer of the United States of America. Gaetz should do President Trump and all of America a favor and withdraw his name from consideration. This will save him considerable embarrassment. America deserves better,"" he added. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee hold the power to confirm or deny Gaetz's appointment as the Attorney General. ***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you receive the latest news.***",CBN,Right,787,"Lean Right

281,Billionaire Garibaldi Thohir-Backed Adaro Andalan Jumps 20% In Jakarta Debut,"Shares of Adaro Andalan Indonesia—a coal mining company backed by Indonesian billionaire Garibaldi Thohir—surged 20% on its trading debut on the Jakarta Stock Exchange as demand for IPOs in Indonesia picked up. The company, which supplies thermal coal used to produce electricity, raised 4.3 trillion rupiah ($271 million) from the IPO by selling 778.7 million shares at 5,550 rupiah, near the lower range of its proposed price of between 5,500 rupiah and 5,900 rupiah each. “The prospects for the thermal coal business are still attractive because coal demand is still quite high, especially because it is supported by economic growth in Asia,” Julius Aslan, president director of Adaro Andalan said in his speech during the listing ceremony on Thursday morning. The shares last traded at 6,650 rupiah after trading was suspended when it reached the daily fluctuation limit. The Adaro Andalan IPO is the largest listing in Indonesia since the debut of gold and copper miner Amman Mineral Internasional in July 2023. That record is set to be surpassed by Daya Intiguna Yasa, the Indonesian unit of Malaysian home improvements chain Mr. DIY, which is raising 4.7 trillion rupiah from its maiden share sale later this month. Adaro Andalan holds the thermal coal assets of Alamtri Resources Indonesia, formerly known as Adaro Energy Indonesia. In September, Alamtri announced it was separating these assets to access additional funding sources. While the group derives majority of its revenue from coal, it projects that more than half of its revenue will come from non-coal businesses by 2030 as it scales up its renewable energy projects and reduces reliance on coal. Alamtri is developing the Kaltara Industrial Park, a 16,000-hectare green industrial complex in North Kalimantan. The park will be powered by a 1,375-megawatt hydropower plant, being built by the company at an estimated cost of $2.6 billion. The industrial facility will also house an aluminum smelter with an initial production capacity of 500,000 tons per year (expandable to as much as 2 million tons) that’s slated for completion next year. Lsat month, Alamtri said it plans to distribute as much as $2.6 billion of dividends to its shareholders to encourage them to support the Adaro Andalan IPO. That sent the company’s shares surging to an all-time high of 4,040 rupiah apiece on November 5. The stock has since retreated to 2,310 rupiah each. Thohir, the CEO of Alamtri has an estimated net worth of $3.3 billion, ranking him No. 17 on the list of Indonesia's 50 richest that was published in December 2023. Thohir also owns a stake in Merdeka Battery Materials, a supplier of raw materials used to make electric vehicle batteries. Additional reporting by Ardian Wibisono.",Forbes,Center,445,"Center

What Trump’s economic picks could foretell for second administrationUnmuteLoading Ad 00:00/01:21 LIVE The first round of December’s Social Security payments, worth up to $4,873 for the highest-income earners who retire at age 70, will go out to the first group of retirees in six days. Here is all you need to know about this month’s Social Security payments, which go out in three rounds. What is it? In 1935, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law. The Social Security Administration was created to manage it. The agency sends monthly checks to retirees to reduce or replace their incomes once they stop working. When does the check arrive? Social Security payments typically begin on the second Wednesday of every month, and the following waves go out in the subsequent weeks. The distribution of payments depends on which day of the month a retiree was born. Retirees born between the 1st and 10th of a month receive their payments on Dec. 11. Beneficiaries born between the 11th and 20th of a month receive their checks on Dec. 18, and retirees born on or after the 21st of a month will receive their payments on Dec. 24. The final payment will be on a Tuesday, as the fourth Wednesday falls on Christmas. When am I eligible? Citizens are eligible for Social Security payments beginning at 62 years old. How can I maximize my check? The time of retirement, the amount paid into Social Security, and the number of years paid into Social Security all affect how much beneficiaries receive in the program. Payments largely depend on the recipients’ retirement age. Retiring at the youngest age, 62, allows up to $2,710 per month, while delaying retirement until 70 can allot up to $4,873 per month, according to the SSA. Beneficiaries can see a personalized estimate of how much they can expect each month through the SSA’s calculator. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER How is it financed? Social Security is financed by a payroll tax paid by employers and employees. Social Security payment amounts are set to shrink unless Congress takes action to prevent it. Analysts estimate the SSA will no longer be able to give out full payments to recipients as early as 2034 due to a rising number of retirees and a shrinking number of workers.",WashingtonExaminer,Lean Right,617,"Center

126,Rep. Andy Harris to Newsmax: Trump's Picks From Congress Well Qualified,"President-elect Donald Trump picked several current and former members of Congress to join his cabinet, and Rep. Andy Harris told Newsmax they are all well-qualified to advance Trump's agenda. ""I can understand the hesitation of the deep state or those on the left at accepting them,"" the Maryland Republican said Friday on ""Wake Up America."" ""But it's because they're so highly qualified and they're going to break up the deep state."" Harris, who has been vocal about the status of the U.S. education system, also said he'd like to see Linda McMahon, Trump's nominee for Secretary for Education, bring about change. ""First of all, we have to go look at the woke universities and make sure we're not subsidizing them and the other thing we have to do is ask why our primary and secondary systems are failing in the global competition for education,"" said Harris. ""The answer is school choice. We clearly have to allow for school choice."" Harris, who chairs the GOP Doctors Caucus, which helps develop patient-centered health care policy, also on Friday praised two other Trump picks: Jay Bhattacharya to head the National Institute of Health and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head Health and Human Services. ""The fact of the matter is that America is getting sicker, not healthier,"" Harris said. ""We know that we have to make major changes to our nutrition system. We have to reexamine how we allow drugs to come to market. Again, we have to review top to bottom why America is getting sicker, not healthier."" Harris further on Friday said he sat in on meetings Thursday with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the leaders of Trump's planned Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and said he found what was said to be ""fascinating."" ""Elon Musk has it right, "" Harris said. ""This is not a democracy. We live in a bureaucracy, not a democracy where unelected bureaucrats are in charge of our lives, and if you don't believe that, go down to the Department of Motor Vehicles. ""The bottom line is that America is tired of bureaucrats running this country because this is a country supposed to be for the people, by the people, and of the people. It's not. It's for and by and of the bureaucrats right now."" Harris also praised Musk and Ramaswamy as ""two of the smartest people I have ever met."" ""They are quick learners,"" Harris said. ""They understand how Washington goes on. They have an understanding of how Congress works. They have an understanding of, again, how this deep state is going to need to be broken up.""

The article presents a story centered around Rep. Andy Harris's positive remarks about Trump's cabinet picks and criticisms of the “deep state,” aligning with right-leaning narratives that emphasize support for Trump's agenda. The language used, including terms such as ""woke universities"" and distrust of bureaucrats, further suggests a right-wing perspective. The focus on conservative educational policies and deregulatory sentiments reinforces the classification as biased towards a right-wing viewpoint."
315,"Trump agrees to DOJ background checks on administration nominees, appointments","President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team said Tuesday that it reached an agreement with the Department of Justice that sets the stage for the department to conduct background checks and start the security clearance process for Trump administration nominees and appointees. The agreement comes amid controversy over some of Trump’s picks for top positions in the government, including the leadership of the Defense Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, the FBI, and the post of director of national intelligence. An agreement to have the FBI, which is a division of the DOJ, conduct background checks on nominees and appointees could make some U.S. senators more comfortable voting to approve Trump’s selections for such posts than they would be without such a deal. Susie Wiles, the incoming White House chief of staff, in a statement, said, “The agreement with the Department of Justice will ensure President Trump and his team are ready on Day 1 to begin enacting the America First Agenda that an overwhelming majority of our nation supported on Election Day.” The Trump transition team said its memorandum of understanding with the DOJ “allows the transition team to submit names for background checks and security clearances.” “Ultimately, this will afford the transition process additional insights, and it facilitates our agency landing teams gaining access to the information they need to prepare for leadership of the federal agencies and departments,” the transition team said in a statement. The MOU was announced a day after an article in The New Yorker detailed allegations of alcohol abuse, sexual impropriety and mismanagement of two non-profit veterans groups by Pete Hegseth, who Trump has tapped to become the next Defense secretary. Shortly after Trump announced his planned nomination of Hegseth, news broke that the former Fox News anchor had been investigated by police, but not criminally charged, for an alleged sexual assault of a woman at a Republican event in California in 2017. Hegseth has denied any wrongdoing. Trump initial pick for U.S. attorney general, Matt Gaetz, dropped out of contention on Nov. 21 after renewed focus on allegations the former Florida congressman had sex with a girl when she was just 17 years in 2017. Gaetz also denies any wrongdoing. Over the weekend, Trump said he would appoint his long-time loyalist Kash Patel as director of the FBI. Patel last year vowed to target judges, lawyers and journalists who he believed were politically motivated in investigating Trump. “Whether it’s criminally or civilly, we’re going to figure that out — but yeah, we’re putting you all on notice,” Patel told former Trump White House aide Steve Bannon in an interview. “We’re actually going to use the Constitution to prosecute them for crimes they said we have always been guilty of but never have.” Trump’s selection of former Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence is another controversial pick. “There’s no question I consider her someone who is likely a Russian asset,” Rep. Debbie Wasserman Shultz, D-Fla., told MSNBC, referring to Gabbard, who would oversee 18 U.S. intelligence agencies as DNI if confirmed by the Senate. The vaccine skeptic and conspiracy promoter Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump has picked to become secretary of HHS, was a heroin user for years as a teen and young adult. Democratic senators have been especially insistent that background checks are needed for all of Trump’s nominees before they can be considered for confirmation by the Senate. Speaking Tuesday to NBC News, Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania said Hegseth’s nomination was part of an “ongoing dialog” among senators about Trump nominees. “It’s really appropriate, though, to have FBI background checks” to help illuminate the allegations against Hegseth, Fetterman said. “My God, you know if you’re going to be in charge of the most lethal organization in the history of humanity ... it would be entirely appropriate too to have a complete background FBI for all of that,” the senator said. The incoming Republican chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which would conduct Hegseth’s confirmation hearing, said Tuesday that some members of his party have concerns about Hegseth. “There are questions that some members have, and we’re going to be looking for an answer,” Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., told NBC News. - Additional reporting by CNBC’s Christina Wilkie",CNBC,Center,713,"Lean Left  
The article focuses on President Trump's administration and includes critical mentions of his nominees, specifically highlighting past controversies and allegations against them. While it reports facts about the background check agreement, the overall tone suggests skepticism about the nominees' qualifications, reflecting a perspective often found in left-leaning media. The inclusion of voices from Democratic senators stressing the need for background checks adds to this analysis. Additionally, the mention of controversies surrounding prominent Republicans indicates a critical stance commonly associated with a Lean Left bias."
197,Trump calls Biden pardoning son Hunter a 'miscarriage of justice',"President-elect Donald Trump has reacted to President Joe Biden issuing a pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, from a possible prison sentence for federal felony gun and tax convictions. Trump called the president's decision a ""miscarriage of justice"" while pointing to those imprisoned for the Jan. 6 riots on the Capitol in his post to Truth Social on Sunday. ""Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!"" Trump wrote. Trump's reaction Sunday comes months after he signaled a Hunter Biden pardon would be something worth considering if he returned to the White House for a second term. During an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in October, the president-elect said he ""wouldn't take it off the books"" when asked about pardoning the sitting president's son. ""See, unlike Joe Biden, despite what they've done to me, where they've gone after me so viciously... and Hunter's a bad boy. There's no question about it. He's been a bad boy. All you had to do is see the laptop from hell,"" he said. ""But I happen to think it's very bad for our country,"" Trump added. In pardoning his son, President Biden spared Hunter the possibility of significant prison time stemming from convictions in two federal cases brought by Special Counsel David Weiss. Over the summer, a jury found Hunter Biden guilty on three felony counts related to his purchase and possession of a firearm while addicted to drugs. And in September, he agreed to plead guilty to nine tax-related charges, including three felonies, on the eve of what was expected to be a lengthy and grueling trial. For the tax charges, Hunter Biden faced up to 17 years in federal prison and $1.35 million in fines. His gun-related conviction carried a potential of up to 25 years in prison. He was scheduled to face sentencing for both cases in the coming weeks – on Dec. 12 on the gun-related charges in Delaware, and Dec. 16 on the tax charges in California. Trump's reaction to President Biden's decision to pardon his son comes weeks after the two met in the Oval Office to call for a ""smooth"" transfer of power when Trump returns to the White House in January. The two presidents, seated by a roaring fire, shook hands in front of reporters and news cameras on Nov. 13. ""Politics is tough, and it's, in many cases, not a very nice world but it is a nice world today,"" Trump said at the time. ""And I appreciate it very much. A transition that's so smooth, it'll be as smooth as it can get, and I very much appreciate that, Joe."" ABC News' Lalee Ibssa, Kelsey Walsh and Soo Rin Kim contributed to this report.",ABC,Lean Left,470,"Lean Right  
The article reflects a minor bias leaning towards the right by focusing on Trump's critical perspective of Biden's pardon decision. It highlights President Trump's comments and frames the discussion in a way that aligns with conservative viewpoints of justice and accountability, especially regarding Hunter Biden's legal issues. However, it maintains a level of neutrality by reporting on events without overtly promoting one viewpoint or another, typical of a lean right classification."

Trump’s union strategy, including pro-labor nominee vs. mixed signalsUnmuteLoading Ad 00:00/03:08 LIVE Senators are looking to prioritize legislation to address the widespread Chinese hacking of U.S. and global telecommunications networks. Lawmakers were recently briefed on a massive hacking effort by a group called Salt Typhoon, which is said to be operated by the Chinese government. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), President-elect Donald Trump’s secretary of state nominee, painted the hack as the worst cybersecurity attack in history. “It’s the most disturbing and widespread incursion into our telecommunications systems in the history of the world, not just the country, because of how massive our telecommunications system is,” Rubio, the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Wednesday. “That’s about as bad as it gets.” After a briefing from officials in the FBI, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, senators expressed outrage over the ability of the attack to take place and a lack of accountability. “There’s no accountability in anybody sitting up there,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) told reporters after the briefing. “They have not told us why they didn’t catch it, what they’ve done to prevent it.” “If somebody came to my office and said, ‘Hey, look, something bad happened, don’t worry, I’m responsible for it, but I’m not going to be responsible for it, and I don’t have any plan to fix it,’ what would you do? You’d fire them,” he said. The shock over the hack has led to a clamoring for legislation to secure the U.S. telecom network, with many aiming to expedite such legislation even before President Joe Biden leaves office. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner (D-VA), who has a background in telecoms, said he would try to push legislation through before the end of the year. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD), who will run the Senate Armed Services Committee’s cyber subcommittee in the next Congress, hinted at legislation. “Yes, there should be, and the question is what’s the appropriate way to put them into play that they can actually adhere to them,” he said when asked if there should be certain regulations in place for telecom companies. “That legislation I believe will be coming.” That legislation could come in waves, as Rounds warned it would take an extended period to digest the extent of the cyberattack fully. “It’s not like getting a new phone, it’s the structure that these cellphone systems have been built on,” Rounds said. The cyberattack was first announced in mid-November by CISA. The agency said the hackers “have compromised networks at multiple telecommunications companies to enable the theft of customer call records data, the compromise of private communications of a limited number of individuals … and the copying of certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Warner told the New York Times at the time that “every major provider has been broken into.” It was the “worst telecom hack in our nation’s history — by far,” he told the Washington Post.",WashingtonExaminer,Lean Right,740,"Center

218,"Trump falls just below 50% in popular vote, but gets more than in past elections","President-elect Donald Trump got very close to a majority of the vote in this presidential election, but not quite. It is not exactly the ""unprecedented and powerful mandate"" Trump claimed on election night. In fact, this year's popular-vote margin is the second-closest since 1968 and still tightening. It shows just how closely divided the country is politically, and that any shift to the right is marginal. Republicans are likely to have the same or a slightly smaller House majority as they have now, and despite new GOP control of the Senate, there is evidence that many Republicans in key states voted for Trump but not necessarily for Republican Senate candidates. With 96% of the vote in, Trump has, according to the Associated Press, 49.97% to Vice President Harris' 48.36%, or 76.9 million votes to 74.4 million. (The U.S. Election Atlas has a higher raw vote total and a slightly narrower margin, 49.78% to 48.23%, or 77.1 million votes to 74.7 million.) It's the highest percentage Trump has received in his three runs at the presidency. (He got just less than 46% in 2016 and less than 47% in 2020.) Votes are still being counted, including provisional and overseas ballots across the country. The 2000 election was decided by just 0.51 percentage points with then-Vice President Al Gore winning the popular vote but losing in the Electoral College to George W. Bush. The 2024 margin may very well get slightly closer, as the provisional ballots have favored Harris and they are coming from blue states like California, Oregon and New York. Of course, U.S. presidential elections are not decided by the popular vote; they are decided by the Electoral College. And on that score, Trump had a fairly wide 312 to 226 Electoral College victory, the widest since 2012. In 2016, Trump also won in the Electoral College but lost the popular vote by 3 million to Democrat Hillary Clinton. A reason for Trump's popular-vote gains this time is that Harris was well below President Biden's 2020 vote totals in blue states. Just in New York and California, Harris was off Biden's totals by almost 3 million votes. And most of that was not vote-switching. In New York, Harris was off by about 900,000 votes, but Trump only gained about 200,000 from his 2020 total. In California, Harris got roughly 1.9 million fewer votes than Biden, but Trump only got about 60,000 more. Often turnout is lower outside of the states that get most of the political attention. This election saw the most political advertising dollars in the smallest field of states. Overall in this election, turnout was just slightly lower than in 2020 at about 63.8%, the second highest in the last 100 years. This year, three of the top turnout states were those formerly Blue Wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Minnesota, Virginia and New Hampshire were also within 5 points and had been considered potentially competitive states. The lowest turnout rates were in Hawaii, Oklahoma, Arkansas, West Virginia, Texas, Mississippi, Tennessee, New York, Indiana and Alabama — all noncompetitive states, either very red or very blue.",NPR,Lean Left,519,"Lean Left  
The article presents a nuanced view of Trump's electoral results, emphasizing the proximity to a majority and the lack of a strong mandate. It highlights the division within the country and suggests that any shift toward Republicanism is marginal, which indicates a critical stance towards Republican results. Additionally, it points out shortcomings in Harris's performance compared to Biden without heavy bias in favor of Trump, showing a tendency towards a critical, yet analytical, perspective often found in left-leaning media."
13,Here’s who Trump might pick for defense secretary if Hegseth withdraws,"Fox News personality Pete Hegseth appears to be in an uphill battle to be confirmed as the next secretary of defense. Now, President-elect Donald Trump is considering several alternatives if his first choice doesn't pan out. On Wednesday, ABC News senior White House correspondent Selina Wang tweeted that there are at least six Republican senators who ""aren't behind"" Trump's choice to oversee the Pentagon. This would sink Hegseth's confirmation, as any Cabinet nominee can only afford three Republican defections if they hope to be confirmed with Vice President-elect JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote (assuming all Democrats also vote no). According to Wang, Trump may end up nominating a secretary of defense more in line with the Republican establishment if Hegseth withdraws his name from consideration. This includes two-term Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis (who ran against Trump in the 2024 Republican primary), Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.), who Trump has already picked as his National Security Advisor. READ MORE: 'Quickly dismantle America': Russian state TV hosts 'thrilled' about these 2 Trump picks The Republican backlash to Hegseth has been slowly building as more reports come out about his alleged alcoholism and lingering questions about a 2020 sexual assault settlement. NBC News reported Wednesday that 10 of Hegseth's current and former coworkers at Fox News say he frequently showed up drunk on set for the Fox & Friends Weekend show that airs at 6 AM, reeked of alcohol and complained about hangovers. They added they Hegseth required colleagues to ""babysit"" him, including calling to wake him up so he wouldn't be late for work. Hegseth's mother, Penelope, also wrote a lengthy email condemning his ""abusive behavior"" toward women while he was in the midst of a contentious divorce from his second wife, Samantha. The New York Times reported that the email — which Penelope Hegseth has since apologized for writing – described his behavior as ""dishonesty, sleeping around, betrayal, debasing [and] belittling."" And she told him to not bother writing back, saying she expected him to ""twist and abuse everything I say anyway."" In 2017, Hegseth was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a Republican conference in California, who suspected he drugged her before the alleged assault. Hegseth maintained the encounter was consensual, though he paid her an undisclosed sum of money in 2020 after she filed a lawsuit, which required she sign a non-disclosure agreement. Trump's appointments of both Hegseth as defense secretary-designate and Kash Patel as the potential next FBI director came as welcome news to Russia-1 host Vladimir Solyvyov. Daily Beast columnist Julia Davis posted the clip of Solyvyov saying the two would ""quickly dismantle America,"" saying: ""And the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.""

While the focus remains on Republican figures, the negative portrayal of Hegseth and references to issues with alcohol and allegations suggests discontent within party ranks.

141,President-Elect Trump Fills Top Roles as Republicans Set to Win Senate and House,"Just three days after Election Day, the transition is already underway for President-elect Donald Trump's second term. The new administration is moving swiftly to fill top roles, while Republicans are on track to take control of both chambers of Congress. After securing his historic second White House term as the 47th president, Trump's team is looking ahead to day-one priorities, including carrying out his campaign promise to deport an estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants and rescind any of the Biden's administration policies that expanded opportunities for migrants to live and work in the U.S. The President-elect is also already starting to fill out his administration. New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is said to be the administration's top candidate for U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. However, no official decision has been made. Women are among the first names to fill administration roles including the appointment of Susie Wiles. Trump's campaign manager will serve as the White House Chief of Staff. Wiles, the daughter of football legend Pat Summerall, is the first woman to hold the influential role. There's quite the shake-up in Washington D.C., from the Oval Office to Capitol Hill. The latest election results appear to put House and Senate Republicans on track to control both chambers of Congress next year. The GOP carrying the Senate with 53 seats following a major upset out of Pennsylvania. Republican David McCormick flipped Democratic incumbent Bob Casey's seat. Like Trump and Republicans across the map, McCormick significantly erased Democratic support. Meanwhile, lawmakers in other states are prepared to challenge the new Trump administration. ""As attorney general, I will continue to use the full force of the law, the full authority of my office to address injustice, to stand up for all people, especially those who have been long overlooked and undervalued, to safeguard reproductive rights,"" said Rob Banta, California's Attorney General. California Governor Gavin Newsom echoed the Attorney General calling for a special session of the state legislature to help fund potential legal challenges to Trump policies affecting women's rights, immigration, and climate. The governors of Illinois and New York are making similar pledges to defend their states against Trump's second-term policies they deem harmful. The president-elect's new mass deportation plan, according to some estimates, could cost upwards of $88 billion a year. Mr. Trump dismissed those price concerns in an interview with NBC News saying, ""There is no price tag to safety.""",CBN,Right,401,"Lean Right

36,Trump Picks Loyalist To Lead The IRS As GOP Eyes Tax Agency,"President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to nominate former Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) to be the next commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service on Wednesday, installing another yet another loyalist to lead a major federal agency. “I have known Billy since 2011 — He is an extremely hard worker, and respected by all, especially by those who know him in Congress,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Taxpayers and the wonderful employees of the IRS will love having Billy at the helm. He is the consummate ‘people person,’ well respected on both sides of the aisle.” Long spent decades working as an auctioneer before he was elected to Congress. He served in the House from 2011 to 2023 before launching a failed bid for one of Missouri’s Senate seats. Since leaving Washington, he has worked as a tax adviser and encouraged businesses to look into a pandemic-era employee retention tax credit. The program has been subject to massive fraud, costing the government billions of dollars, and some lawmakers have tried to end it. The IRS temporarily paused it earlier this year in order to catch up on false claims. Democrats were skeptical of the pick. “There are a lot of reasons why former Congressman Billy Long is a bizarre choice for this role,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement to RollCall. “What’s most concerning is that Mr. Long left office and jumped into the scam-plagued industry involving the Employee Retention Tax Credit.” The move effectively means Trump will fire the current IRS commissioner, Danny Werfel, who was appointed to a five-year term by President Joe Biden in 2022. He took over the agency shortly after Congress approved an $80 billion expansion in funding over the next decade, which experts say will help the government more accurately enforce tax laws and collect revenue. Republicans scaled back that funding by $20 billion last year and are eyeing billions more, which official warn would limit the agency’s ability to audit wealth Americans and large corporations. Werfel — who worked for both Democrats and Republicans — had said he intended to finish out his term, but the sitting president is able to appoint who they like as long as they are confirmed by the Senate. “I have a vision of my last day on the job being Nov. 12, 2027,” Werfel said during a podcast appearance last month. “My frame of mind on the IRS is that it’s nonpartisan, is that our priorities can and should shift with new Treasury leadership.”",Huffpost,Left,425,"Lean Right  
The article discusses Trump's nomination of a loyalist to the IRS, positioning it within a broader context of partisan tensions regarding tax policy and agency management. The language used to describe Trump's choice may project a sense of approval, while the criticism from Democrats frames Long's appointment as problematic. The emphasis on loyalty and the political implications bodes more favorably for a Republican viewpoint, aligning with a ""Lean Right"" classification without fully endorsing extreme views."
198,Stowaway who flew from New York to Paris returns to NYC to face charges,"NEW YORK -- The woman accused of sneaking onto a Delta Air Lines flight from New York City to Paris last week returned to John F. Kennedy International Airport on Wednesday. The suspect, identified as Svetlana Dali, a 57-year-old Russian National, boarded a Delta flight to return to New York from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, after a previous attempt was derailed by an outburst. She was escorted by French law enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents. The plane was greeted by police when it landed. Dali was later arrested by the FBI and was expected to spend the night in jail before making an appearance at U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on Thursday, the bureau said. Dali, who lives in Philadelphia, is accused of sneaking past airport security and boarding a Delta flight to Paris on Nov. 26 without a boarding pass. The Transportation Security Administration confirmed it reviewed security footage showing Dali using a TSA lane for known crew members. That lane eventually merges with the general public, at which point Dali is seen mingling with a group of people getting their IDs checked before slipping by. She did go through a body scanner, and her bag was flagged during screening for having two bottles of water, which she discarded.

344,"In Ohio, Lessons from Satanic Temple Offered as Bible-Study Alternative","Ohio students are now eligible to receive lessons from a Satanic Temple as part of the state’s “religious release” program, in which students may be excused from school to attend an off-campus course on religion. As an alternative to the LifeWise Academy’s Bible-study program now available to Ohio students, the Hellion Academy of Independent Learning will offer off-campus classes once a month during the school day for students at Edgewood Elementary School, beginning in December. Leaders of the Satanic Temple insist that the initiative sprung up from the wishes of parents. One mom, Betty Elswick, expressed her desire for a wider range of options. “We wanted to make sure that we had a program that was teaching compassion and empathy and also inclusion,” Elswick said. “Several parents had expressed concerns about their kids coming home and being bullied or made fun of and teased for not participating in the other programs in the area.” “It is not to push a religious agenda. It’s just to have an alternative,” she added. The Satanic Temple attempted to quash concerns over the stigma attached to its name. “We aren’t trying to shut the LifeWise Academy down, but I do think a lot of school districts don’t realize when they open the door for one religion, they open it for all of them,” June Everett, an ordained minister with the Satanic Temple, told WCMH Channel 4. “We are not devil worshipers. Different Satanists across the United States will give you different answers depending on how they personally believe,” Everett said. “But as a whole, we are non-theistic, meaning we don’t believe in any supernatural deities and that includes, you know, God or Satan.” LifeWise CEO Joel Penton chimed in on the new program. “We believe all families should have the opportunity to choose religious study during school hours, and we trust parents to make the best choice for their children.” Penton is promoting an adaptation to the existing state bill that would call on all Ohio school districts to not only allow but require students to leave campus during the day for religious teaching of some kind.

The article presents the situation of the Satanic Temple offering an alternative to Bible study in Ohio schools within a framework that emphasizes inclusion and parental choice. The tone suggests support for diverse religious practices and critiques the establishment of a single religious framework in public schools, aligning with values typically endorsed by left-leaning views. Additionally, the portrayal of the Satanic Temple emphasizes compassion and empathy, framing it positively to counter stigma. This positions the article more towards the Lean Left side of the media bias spectrum."
164,"In first call, Russian defense chief cautioned top US general about large-scale military exercise in Mediterranean Sea","In their first ever call, Russia’s defense chief cautioned the top US general about a large-scale Russian military exercise in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, according to a US official, with tensions running high between the two countries over the escalating war in Ukraine. The call between Chief of Russian General Staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov and US Ch﻿airman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown, which was initiated by Gerasimov, occurred November 27. On Tuesday, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that it had launched hypersonic missiles and cruise missiles as part of an exercise in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Russian frigates, Admiral of the Soviet Union Fleet Gorshkov and Admiral Golovko, fired Tsirkon hypersonic missiles as part of the exercise, which included the Russian Navy and Aerospace Forces. The submarine Novorossiysk launched Kalibr cruise missiles at a naval target, according to the ministry. The exercise involved more than 1,000 troops; 10 ships; and 24 aircraft, including MiG-31 fighter jets armed with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, the ministry said. Gerasimov did not explicitly mention the launch of hypersonic missiles in the call, according to the US official. The US currently has two destroyers operating in the Mediterranean Sea, the USS Bulkeley and the USS Arleigh Burke, according to a spokesman for the Navy. The New York Times was first to report on the call between Gerasimov and Brown. This was the first call between Gerasimov and Brown since Brown became Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman more than one year ago. An official readout of the discussion normally follows calls between Brown and his military counterparts, but the Russians asked not to do so in this case. A spokesman for Brown confirmed the call happened but did not offer details, only saying, “The leaders discussed a number of global and regional security issues to include the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.” Capt. Jereal Dorsey said in a statement, “At the request of Gen. Gerasimov, Gen. Brown agreed not to proactively announce the call.” There was no mention in the statement of the exercises in the Mediterranean Sea. The US official said the two also discussed US concern over the deployment of North Korean troops to the battlefield and Russia’s use of an intermediate-range ballistic missile with multiple warheads in late-November. Another topic that came up in the call, the official said, was the US giving Ukraine permission to fire long-range ATACMS missiles into Russia. US and Russia maintain deconfliction lines in certain combat zones to avoid unintentional encounters when the two militaries operate near each other. That line has been used recently in the Middle East to prevent any friction between US and Russian forces operating in Syria, the Pentagon said. But since the start of the war in Ukraine nearly three years ago, the US and Russian military chiefs have rarely spoken, despite repeated outreach efforts by the US as the war began. Gerasimov spoke with former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Gen. Mark Milley in March 2023 after a Russian fighter jet struck and downed a US MQ-9 Reaper drone over the Black Sea.",CNN,Lean Left,514,"Center  
The article provides a factual account of a military communication between Russian and US officials without displaying a clear bias towards either side. It presents information about military exercises, official statements, and events in a neutral tone, focusing on the details of the call and the context surrounding it. The language used is straightforward and avoids emotive terminology that would suggest a particular political leaning, making it suitable for a center classification."
113,Democrat Senator Shocks ‘The View’: Pardon Is Warranted In Trump’s NY Case,"Senator John Fetterman (D-PA) told the liberal hosts of ABC’s “The View” that he believed a pardon was called for in “the trial in New York” for President-elect Donald Trump, saying that it was a clear example of a politically motivated prosecution.Fetterman joined the cohosts of the midday talk show on Thursday, and the discussion turned to President Joe Biden’s Thanksgiving weekend pardon of his embattled son, Hunter Biden. Fetterman also claimed that the case against Hunter Biden — which was brought by a special prosecutor and President Biden’s Justice Department — was politically motivated, arguing that pardons would be reasonable in both cases.“So, Senator, President Biden’s decision to pardon his son Hunter is facing bipartisan backlash. Even the Democrats are all over it. But what do you think?” host Joy Behar asked, attempting to downplay the pardon. “Is this much ado about nothing? It is his son, after all, and people do have sympathy for that, but a lot of people are angry with him about that. What do you say?”“I think it’s undeniable that the case against Hunter Biden was really politically motivated but I also think it’s true that the trial in New York for Trump, that was political as well too,” Fetterman replied. “In both cases, I think a pardon is appropriate. And I really think collectively America’s confidence in these kinds of institutions have been damaged by these kinds of cases.”WATCH:AdvertisementFetterman calls out Democratic Party hypocrisy on criminal justice reform and second chances while saying Trump shouldn't be president because he's a convicted felon. Adding: ""…charges would have never been brought unless one side could realize they could weaponize that."" pic.twitter.com/hnECB6Qg6a— Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) December 5, 2024Behar jumped back into the conversation, fretting that the same argument could be made about the people facing charges and prison time for crimes related to January 6th.AdvertisementCHECK OUT THE DAILY WIRE HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDE“They’ll say that about the J-6 people too though, right? That’s what they’re going to say on the other side,” she complained. “That that is weaponized also.”Fetterman pushed back, saying he wasn’t going that far with the argument: “I’m not referring to that. I’m talking about the New York trial and now — the Democrats, on our side, there were some that were gleeful calling it — well, ‘now he’s a convicted felon,'” Fetterman continued, arguing that it made Democrats look dishonest when they claimed to be in favor of things like criminal justice reform and second chances while celebrating Trump’s conviction and arguing that he did not deserve a moment’s grace for anything.AdvertisementThe cohosts of “The View,” whether Fetterman realized it or not, were among those Democrats who gleefully crowed about the fact that Trump had been convicted in the New York case, and went out of their way to refer to him as a “convicted felon” as often as possible.“I felt like America won! I felt like I won!” cohost Sunny Hostin said after the verdict was announced.Advertisement",DailyWire,Right,495,"Lean Left  
The article highlights a Democratic senator's perspective on politically motivated prosecutions, using quotes from a liberal talk show. The framing of Fetterman's statements and the focus on the perceived hypocrisy of Democrats leans towards a left-leaning interpretation of political events, while also being critical of Democratic reactions to pardons. However, it does present some balanced viewpoints, making it more of a ""Lean Left"" classification rather than strongly left."
156,'Doing very well': Trump rallies behind defense secretary pick Hegseth but invites DeSantis to Army-Navy game,"close Trump reportedly considering DeSantis for defense secretary Fox News’ Bill Melugin reports the latest on the Trump transition after the president-elect meets with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida will join President-elect Trump next weekend at the annual Army-Navy college football game, two sources familiar tell Fox News. The teaming up of DeSantis and Trump — for the second time this month — comes as multiple sources have confirmed that the president-elect is considering nominating the governor as defense secretary as a possible replacement for Pete Hegseth, Trump's embattled current pick to steer the Pentagon.But the move also comes as Trump on Friday took to social media to write that ""Hegseth is doing very well. His support is strong and deep, much more so than the Fake News would have you believe."" DeSantis, a popular conservative governor and a Navy veteran who served in the Iraq War, waged a bitter battle last year and early this year with Trump during a very combative and divisive GOP presidential nomination race. But the two Republican heavyweights seemed to make peace after the primaries, and DeSantis helped raise funds for Trump during the general election.

Another source told Fox News' chief political anchor and ""Special Report"" host Bret Baier that it was the president-elect himself who floated the governor's name, and that Trump and DeSantis discussed the idea as they met Tuesday while appearing together in Florida at a memorial service for fallen law enforcement officers in Palm Beach County.

WATCH: HEGSETH PUSHES BACK AGAINST REPORTERS Hegseth, an Army National Guard officer who deployed to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and who previously was a Fox News host, is facing a series of drinking and sexual misconduct allegations. He has denied allegations that he mistreated women and has vowed that he won't drink ""a drop of alcohol"" if confirmed as defense secretary. VideoA seemingly defiant Hegseth told reporters on Thursday afternoon that ""this will not be a process tried in the media. I don’t answer to anyone in this group. None of you, not to that camera at all. I answer to President Trump, who received 76 million votes on behalf... and a mandate for change. I answer to the 100 senators who are part of this process and those in the committee. And I answer to my Lord and Savior and my wife and my family.""Trump, in his social media post, argued that Hegseth ""will be a fantastic, high energy, Secretary of Defense . . . , one who leads with charisma and skill.""

Trump to visit France’s Notre Dame in first foreign trip as president-electUnmuteLoading Ad 00:00/10:17 LIVE President Joe Biden’s national security adviser warned that the United States could quickly run out of munitions if a war with China broke out. “God forbid we end up in a full-scale war with the PRC,” Jake Sullivan said on Wednesday at a Center for Strategic and International Studies event, referencing the People’s Republic of China. “But any war with a country like the PRC, a military like the PRC, is going to involve the exhaustion of munition stockpiles very rapidly.” U.S. defense officials believe the PRC is the country’s biggest threat, and with its rapid military modernization and expansion, there have been questions about whether the U.S. would be ready for a conflict in the Pacific. Chinese leaders have said they want their military to be prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027, though U.S. defense leaders have said the date does not guarantee a decision to carry out such an operation has been made. Sullivan warned that the U.S. needs to be “stockpiling both the vital munitions we know we’ll need in sufficient quantities and the components needed to produce them on short notice.” While he said the U.S. “is uniquely capable of” evolving and adapting, he acknowledged that China has “the single biggest advantage,” which he said was “the sheer scope and scale of production,” and insisted the U.S. has to “close the gap.” The concern has also been highlighted by the U.S.’s continued military support for Israel and Ukraine. Adm. Samuel Paparo, the U.S. Navy’s top commander in the Indo-Pacific, warned last month that the Pentagon’s decision to provide Ukraine with artillery pieces and short-range weapons didn’t initially have a significant impact on relevant stockpiles but that the systems the U.S. has provided to Ukraine, as well as Israel, more recently has had an effect. The U.S. has sent Kyiv at least two Patriot systems and deployed a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, one out of the six in its arsenal, to Israel. “Up to this year, where most of the employment of weapons were really artillery pieces and short-range weapons, I had said, ‘Not at all,’ but now, with some of the Patriots that have been employed, some of the air-to-air missiles that have been employed, it’s now eating into stocks,” Paparo added. “And to say otherwise would be dishonest.” The subject of munition stockpiles has become a major topic of attention due to the Pentagon’s continued support for Ukraine in a war that has spanned nearly three years. The U.S. has also continued to provide billions of dollars of aid to Israel as it faces threats from enemies such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, all of whom have Iran’s backing. Sullivan acknowledged on Wednesday that over an eight-week period in 2022, Ukraine used a year’s worth of U.S. 155-millimeter artillery. He said the U.S. industrial base, during a stretch, was only able to increase production about 400 rounds a month, “enough for Ukraine to fend itself for a few extra hours.” “The deeper we looked, the clearer it became that we needed larger stocks, many critical munitions and weapons platforms, both to maintain U.S. readiness and to equip a partner under attack,” Sullivan explained. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER By the time the new administration is inaugurated on Jan. 20, the defense industrial base will be producing 55,000 155-millimeter artillery rounds a month, and by early 2026, that should extend to 100,000 monthly. In addition to the threat of a conflict with Beijing, Sullivan noted that over the last couple of years, the U.S. has seen deepening military ties between China and adversaries such as Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Sullivan said it could be more than a decade before the U.S. is in a place to “breathe a sigh of relief.”",WashingtonExaminer,Lean Right,870,"Center

189,"As America Votes, These Big Energy Projects Hang in the Balance","The outcome of next week’s US presidential election is poised to have profound implications for a handful of multi-billion-dollar energy projects. Republican Donald Trump, who has vowed to end climate policies he’s dubbed Washington’s “green new scam,” has pledged to get producers pumping more oil and gas to bring down energy costs. “They’ll be drilling so much,” Trump saidBloomberg Terminal at a rally last week in Greenville, NC. “If they drill themselves out of business, I don’t give a damn, right? We’re going to get your prices down so low.” Democrat Kamala Harris, meanwhile, has hailed the promise of innovation and investment in emission-free energy as a way to drive economic growth while lowering household bills. She’s largely expected to stay the course that President Joe Biden charted on the issues, including by moving to restrict emissions from facilities that have escaped previous regulation, though some environmentalists hope she’ll take a harder stance. Of course, candidates’ past positions aren’t necessarily proof of what’s to come — take Harris’ shifting stance on fracking, for instance — and both campaigns didn’t respond when asked if their earlier statements still hold. But with a lot of money, infrastructure and potential climate impacts on the line, the owners of energy projects planned or operating across the US are bracing for potential changes from Washington. Here are three of the projects with the most at stake: The future of Venture Global LNG Inc.’s proposed liquefied natural gas export facility in Louisiana, known as CP2, was thrown into question earlier this year when Biden paused issuing new LNG export licenses following vocal opposition from climate activists. Even though a federal judge halted the moratorium in July, the situation has been little changed. Before he leaves office, Biden could lift the pause himself or direct the Energy Department to write new rules governing when proposed LNG exports are in the public interest. But even if he were to kick off changes, the outcome would be shaped by the next president. Trump has vowed he’d end the licensing pause his first day in the White House. “We’ll supply all of Asia with oil and gas, which they need,” Trump promised a recent rally in Pennsylvania. Harris hasn’t specified what she’d do on the issue, though she has often highlighted the surge in US oil and gas production under the Biden-Harris administration — a signal to voters she could take a more moderate stance toward fossil fuels if elected. Related: Harris Touts Record Oil Boom in Rare Embrace of Fossil Fuels CP2 would process about 20 million metric tons of LNG a year — and, according to opponents, would produce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to putting 1.8 million new gasoline-fueled cars on the road. Venture Global says the project will export enough natural gas to replace 33 coal-fired power plants, enough to reduce approximately 140 million tons of greenhouse gases per year. Other companies waiting for such export licenses include Energy Transfer LP and closely-held Commonwealth LNG. Eight years ago, Energy Transfer’s Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) that transports oil from North Dakota to Illinois was thrust into the national spotlight following a series of grassroots protests near the Standing Rock reservation. Now, the next president may have a chance to make or break its future. The nearly 1,200-mile pipeline, which has been operating since Trump’s first year in office, is still waiting for the US Army Corps of Engineers to redo its environmental analysis of the pipeline’s path under Lake Oahe, used by nearby Native American tribes as a source of water. The agency outlined five possible outcomes in its court-ordered draft analysis last year, from seeking a reroute to allowing the company to increase the volume of oil permitted under the existing easement, but it sidestepped identifying its preferred approach. Even if that recommendation comes as part of a final environmental impact statement before the end of the year, the new president could still step in. Trump already took action on the issue when he was in charge, issuing an executive order expediting DAPL’s approval. After leaving the White House, he signaled his support hadn’t changed: “If I were president right now,” he told Fox BusinessBloomberg Terminal in 2021, “they’d all be working like crazy to build pipelines.” Energy Transfer Chief Executive Officer Kelcy Warren is a top Trump donor. The company didn’t reply to requests for comment. Harris hasn’t explicitly said what she would do, but she wasn’t shy about criticizing the project as a US senator from California, arguing it threatened tribal rights and access to clean water. “Opposing DAPL is about protecting the water we drink and leaving our children a sustainable future,” Harris wrote in February 2017 following Trump’s order. Three years later, Harris joined a group of Democrats in an amicus brief urging a federal district court to halt pipeline flows while the environmental review was underway. Progressives prioritizing DAPL’s closure face long odds, said Christine Tezak, a senior director with Washington-based consulting firm ClearView Energy Partners. “It’s a lot harder to shut something down once its operating.” Offshore wind projects depend on the federal government from cradle to grave — from the leases they’re built on to the policies that govern their eventual decommissioning. With the Republican nominee harboring a long-running disdain toward the sector, pledging in May “to write it out in an executive order,” a Trump win would put any offshore wind farm in a precarious position. Projects still awaiting final authorizations would be at greater peril, subject to indefinite delays if the government were to halt permitting. The 2.4-gigawatt SouthCoast Wind farm planned near Massachusetts is especially at risk, given its timeline. The site is expected to clear a US environmental review later this year and could even win a positive record of decision approving the project before Biden leaves office. But that would leave Ocean Winds North America LLC still missing a key federal authorization needed to begin construction. And right now, the US government says that is unlikely to come before late March. “Ocean Winds will continue to develop our US projects, including SouthCoast Wind, in the coming years, and we stand ready to work together with the administration to build a prosperous clean energy future,” Michael Brown, CEO of Ocean Winds North America, said in an emailed statement. Other projects still pending at the Interior Department include ventures planned by Avangrid Inc., Orsted AS, EDF Renewables and Shell New Energies US LLC.

11,GOP senator suggests Hegseth wasn’t an adult 7 years ago: 'It doesn’t matter',"US Senator Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) suggested on Wednesday that Donald Trump defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth was not an adult seven years ago — although the MAGA nominee was 37 years old.

They said the statements were used as ideological litmus tests and enforced intellectual conformity.“I applaud the provost for ending the practice of requiring diversity statements,” said Sarah Hubbard, one of the regents on the eight-person board overseeing the university. “This policy change removes a barrier to diversity of thought on campus by eliminating the ideological litmus test.”Provost Laurie McCauley announced the decision on Thursday after forming a faculty committee to review the use of diversity statements.“Critics of diversity statements perceive them as expressions of personal identity traits, support of specific ideology or opinions on socially-relevant issues, and serve as a ‘litmus test’ of whether a faculty member’s views are politically acceptable,” the committee stated in a report. “Thus, as currently enacted, diversity statements have the potential to limit viewpoints and reduce diversity of thought among faculty members.”AdvertisementWhile the University of Michigan Board of Regents is set to meet on Thursday, Hubbard says she doesn’t expect it to address any other DEI issues at this time.CHECK OUT THE DAILY WIRE HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDEThe University of Michigan’s decision follows the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s announcement over the summer that it would discontinue using DEI statements in the hiring process.Advertisement“Requests for a statement on diversity will no longer be part of applications for any faculty positions at MIT,” one MIT representative said at the time.“My goals are to tap into the full scope of human talent, to bring the very best to MIT, and to make sure they thrive once here,” MIT President Sally Kornbluth said. “We can build an inclusive environment in many ways, but compelled statements impinge on freedom of expression, and they don’t work.”Harvard University’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences also announced this summer that it would discontinue the use of diversity statements in its hiring process.Advertisement",DailyWire,Right,352,"Lean Right  
The article focuses on the University of Michigan's decision to eliminate DEI statements in faculty hiring, highlighting the support from specific regents and framing the decision as a means to foster diversity of thought. The emphasis on perceived ideological conformity around DEI policies and the showcasing of approval from conservative-leaning figures like Sarah Hubbard suggest a bias that favors the right's viewpoint on this issue. The language used reinforces a narrative against mandated DEI measures, aligning more closely with a lean-right perspective."

And I could have one for the first time in my whole 30 years of living — it was not true,” she said.“I cannot smile anymore,” Trainor went on. “Everywhere I go, I cannot smile. My face hurts to smile, to even try.”AdvertisementTrainor demonstrated her new look, saying, “This is as big as I can smile,” while addressing the camera.She then shared a photo of herself holding a dog at a shelter. She said she was a “happy person” in the photo even if she didn’t look like it. “I look like I smelled someone’s fart,” she joked while speaking with her brother on the podcast. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Workin’ On It Podcast (@workinonitpod)AdvertisementThe singer told her followers, “Don’t try everything.”The “Whoops” singer said despite the cosmetic procedure fail, she’s still planning on getting a breast procedure in the future.AdvertisementCHECK OUT THE DAILY WIRE HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDETrainor said she wants to get “just a little lift,” and “maybe a little implant just so they’re like, ‘We are boobs,’ ‘cause right now, they are not.”According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, a lip flip uses Botox “to relax a muscle in the upper lip, causing the lip to ‘flip’ and giving the appearance of a fuller upper lip. The procedure is different than getting lip fillers, which are injections directly into the lip, as opposed to above it.”The procedure is said to look more “natural” than traditional fillers.Several celebrities have been forthcoming about their plastic surgery failures in the past. Last year, “Little House on the Prairie” actress Melissa Gilbert said she underwent cosmetic surgery that made her look like “the spawn of Satan.”“I had no facial expression, which is anathema considering what I do for a living,” Gilbert said at the time, adding, “It’s exhausting keeping up that kind of façade. I was very insecure.”Advertisement",DailyWire,Right,390,"Center  
The article provides a straightforward account of Meghan Trainor's experience with cosmetic procedures without showcasing any particular bias or agenda. It reports her regrets and personal comments on her situation in a neutral tone, while also including relevant information about the procedure and some context about other celebrities. The focus remains on Trainor's perspective, making it an objective piece rather than leaning towards any ideological stance."
63,'Would Be A Big Story': Maggie Haberman Digs Into Trump's Thinking On Ron DeSantis,"Donald Trump is reportedly considering Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) as his replacement defense secretary nominee, and Maggie Haberman unpacked the president-elect’s reasoning for picking a recent critic. DeSantis, originally considered Trump’s biggest competition for the GOP nomination, was openly critical of the president-elect during the primaries. But he ultimately endorsed Trump and apparently managed to get back in his good books. “It’s the kind of thing Donald Trump loves, right?” the New York Times reporter said Wednesday on CNN’s “The Source.” “He has told people that privately, that it would be a big story if he brought in somebody who he had had this feud with in a primary.” “It would be a big story, because he’s a conquest, and he’s somebody who Trump not just beat but trounced in those primaries,” she added. “Ron DeSantis is the person who the New York Post had put on their front page in 2022 as the future,” she continued. “And that obviously did not last. So I understand why for Donald Trump, who we know likes this kind of a narrative about people falling in line with him, this is appealing.” Moreover, she argued, DeSantis would likely be confirmed easily by the Senate, and he aligns with Trump’s agenda for the military, specifically with regards to targeting what they call “woke” policies. Trump’s current pick for defense secretary, former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, has faced mounting allegations of misconduct in recent weeks, and his chances of confirmation appear to be getting slimmer. DeSantis, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) are reportedly among the names being floated to replace him.",Huffpost,Left,272,"Center  
The article presents information about Donald Trump's consideration of Ron DeSantis for a cabinet position without expressing overtly partisan opinions or strong biases. It includes viewpoints from both sides, mentioning DeSantis's previous criticisms and their eventual reconciliation.

302,LA 2028 Games enjoy support of incoming Trump administration says IOC,"The Los Angeles Olympics were awarded in 2017 when Trump was president following his first election victory. Trump also met Bach at the White House in 2017 shortly before the Games were awarded to Los Angeles. While the LA Games do not depend on federal funding like most other Olympics, as the project is privately funded, the federal government plays a key role in providing security, transport and travel assistance amongst other areas of support for the event. ""It is in the best hands of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee and the organising committee,"" Bach told a press conference when asked about relations with the new U.S. administration taking over in January. ""Whenever they (USOPC) would deem it appropriate the IOC will be at their side. We are very confident with regard to the steps and efforts being undertaken by the organising committee and the USOPC, taking early contact with the incoming team,"" Bach said. ""We saw also that President-elect Trump repeatedly declared the support for the Games, which we never had any doubt (about). He has declared this support from the very beginning."" The first Trump administration in 2017 enacted a travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries, which the President at the time said was needed to protect the U.S. against attacks by Islamist militants. That had caused concern in the sports world with the Olympics bringing together more than 10,500 athletes from more than 200 countries. Tens of thousands more are foreign support staff, coaches, referees, media and fans from abroad. President Joe Biden ended the travel ban when he took office in 2021. Last month LA Games officials said they had been in contact with the incoming Trump administration and were confident that the U.S. federal government would deliver on its promises to support the Games.",Reuters,Center,301,"Lean Right  
The article discusses the support from the Trump administration for the LA 2028 Games, positively framing Trump's involvement and emphasizing the continuity of support from the U.S. government under his leadership.

Additionally, there is no negative bias toward Trump or his policies, positioning the article closer to a right-leaning perspective while maintaining a degree of neutrality in the reporting."
226,"Meet Kashyap ‘Kash’ Patel, Trump’s Nomination for FBI Director","President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Kashyap “Kash” Patel—a lawyer and former Chief of Staff to the then Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller—to serve as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). “Kash is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People,” Trump said in his Truth Social post announcing the nomination on Nov. 30. “He played a pivotal role in uncovering the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, standing as an advocate for truth, accountability, and the Constitution.” If confirmed, Patel, 44, would replace FBI Director Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump in 2017. Wray still has three years remaining in his 10-year term, so in order for Patel to take over, Wray would need to resign or be fired. Patel will also need to be confirmed by the now Republican-controlled Senate. Speaking out via X (formerly Twitter) on Dec. 1, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a Republican, said Wray had “failed at fundamental duties” of being the FBI director and argued it was time to “chart a new course” of “transparency and accountability.” Of Patel’s nomination, he added: “Kash Patel must prove to Congress he will reform and restore public trust in [the] FBI.” Trump has shown special interest in the FBI and the position of FBI director after he fired former FBI Director James Comey in 2017 during a time when the agency was investigating the Trump campaign’s possible ties to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. In Patel, though, Trump has appointed a potential director who has shown extreme loyalty to him. Here is what to know about Patel in light of his prestigious nomination by Trump to lead America’s principal law enforcement agency. Prior to his stint in D.C., Patel was a public defender in Miami until he took a job with the Justice Department in 2014. During Trump’s first term, Patel served as the Deputy Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Counterterrorism at the National Security Council. Patel previously served as Chief of Staff to the then Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller. He also served as an aide to former California representative and House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes during the inquiry into the FBI’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. It was reported that before leaving office in early 2021, Trump had floated the idea of Patel being the FBI’s deputy director. However, in his 2022 memoir One Damn Thing After Another, former Attorney General William Barr wrote: “Patel had virtually no experience that would qualify him to serve at the highest level of the world's preeminent law enforcement agency.” After Trump left the White House, he seemingly maintained a close relationship with Patel. During the investigation into Trump’s classified documents, Patel refused to testify against Trump before a federal grand jury, asserting his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. (He did eventually testify, after the Justice Department granted him immunity). This nomination is in line with Trump’s plans to do a major overhaul of federal organizations, as Patel is known for his criticism of the FBI, and outlined in his 2023 book Government Gangsters his plans “to defeat the deep state.” In his book, he also reportedly argued that the FBI has “become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken.” Patel has shared more plans in interviews over the past few years. In a conversation with the Shawn Ryan Show podcast, Patel said on “day one” he would “shut down” the FBI’s headquarters building and “reopen it the next day as a museum of the ‘deep state.’” “And I’d take the seven thousand employees that work in that building and send them across America to go chase down criminals,” he continued. In an interview last year with former White House Chief Strategist and right-wing agitator Steve Bannon (conducted before Bannon’s incarceration), Patel listened as Bannon said he thought Patel would be a future Patel CIA director. In response, Patel said he “will go out to find the conspirators not just in government but in the media.” “Yes, we are gonna come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,” he continued, furthering Trump’s claims that the 2020 election—in which he lost to President Joe Biden—was “stolen.” Patel was born in Garden City, New York, to Indian immigrant parents. He dedicated his book Government Gangsters to his parents, writing thanks to them “for daring to cross the Earth in search of the American Dream.” On his upbringing, he writes that his home was always “busy with my siblings, my parents, my dad’s eight brothers and sisters, and me all living in the same house.” He also says that he has a “very deep connection with India,” and was raised with the Hindu faith. Patel completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Richmond in Virginia and then attended law School at Pace University in New York.",TIME,Lean Left,843,"Lean Right  
The article predominantly reflects a pro-Trump perspective, emphasizing the positive attributes and loyalty of Kashyap Patel while aligning with Trump's narratives regarding the FBI and ""deep state."" The language used is favorable to Patel and his views, suggesting a pattern of media bias that leans towards conservative ideals and supports the Republican agenda. Moreover, it presents criticisms of the FBI without extensive counterpoints, indicating a bias that favors right-wing viewpoints."
283,Forbes Daily: Clock Is Ticking For Last-Minute Tax Tricks,"Good morning, As 2024 dwindles to its final weeks, it’s high time to consider financial moves for tax purposes, such as a tax-deductible gift to a nonprofit. While donations to U.S. charities technically rose to more than $557 billion in 2023, overall giving actually declined when adjusted for inflation. Many point to an increased standard deduction—thanks to the 2017 Trump tax cuts—as an explanation for this drop in giving because fewer taxpayers are choosing to itemize. Remember to choose wisely, only donations to qualified charitable organizations are deductible on your federal taxes, and always ask for a receipt—even for cash. And if you’re interested in other tax dodges—cough—strategic moves that might make sense before December 31, keep reading for year-end tax advice from Forbes senior contributor William Baldwin. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol lifted his declaration of emergency martial law Tuesday, hours after first announcing a decree seizing control of the national media and banning “political activities.” The last time martial law was declared in South Korea was in 1980, during an uprising against the country’s then-military dictatorship. A U.S. national security official said the U.S. was not notified prior to Yoon’s decision. MORE: Lawmakers from South Korea’s opposition parties submitted a motion to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol Wednesday, amid widespread public anger and protests. The motion will likely be put to a vote later this week, though several senior members of Yoon’s staff have already resigned. President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly considering Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as a potential defense secretary nominee, amid growing doubts about his current pick Pete Hegseth’s chances of securing Senate confirmation as he faces scrutiny over allegations of sexual assault and drunken public behavior. Picking DeSantis for a cabinet role would mark a turnaround in his relationship with Trump, who repeatedly mocked the governor once he emerged as the president-elect’s main challenger in the GOP primary.

Kennedy Jr., have promoted. TOPLINE AI hype is alive and well, but those looking to make their mark as a founder or business owner would do well to consider the advice of Nick Huber: Forget about changing the world. Huber’s first business didn’t begin with a slick pitch deck to potential investors or an analysis of the total addressable market but with a simple Craigslist ad subletting his place. He ended up creating Storage Squad, a summer service for college kids that picked up and stored their stuff over break, and would later sell the business in 2021 for $1.75 million. The experience helped him develop a startup philosophy that seems well suited to an age when so many white-collar workers feel threatened by AI. “AI will never be able to clean, build and maintain our physical world. The sweatier the job, the better,’’ he declares. The 35-year-old Huber has made millions by not being a Wall Street wizard or coding apps that claim to “change the world.” Instead, he has built or invested in 11 businesses that together, he says, generated more than $50 million in sales last year. None are based in Manhattan or Menlo Park. They don’t retain fancy PR firms or claim to be making earth-shattering breakthroughs. Almost all of them were bootstrapped—and Huber insists that they earn their keep within a matter of months. He figures his network of storage facilities, which last year had $15 million in revenue, is worth around $140 million based on its $9.8 million in net operating income and the valuation of publicly traded storage companies. Add the value of his holdings in other companies, and Forbes estimates Huber is worth about $35 million. Huber hasn’t limited himself to dirty businesses. But he thinks that is the best place for most aspiring entrepreneurs to start. WHY IT MATTERS Huber’s approach to finding opportunities is simple but compelling: Just look around you, see what services are making money and figure out if you can do them better. As it expanded, Storage Squad picked its targets through common sense and a little experience—not big marketing studies. “We figured out quickly that the private expensive schools with a lot of out-of-state students were our wheelhouse,” says Huber. “A state school in the south, like the University of Georgia, the kids are resourceful, they drive trucks, they go rent storage units.” The same can’t be said for Boston, where “they’ve got dad’s Amex and they’re ready to solve the problem with a couple hundred bucks.” MORE How To Now Get Nearly Unlimited Funding To Build Your Small Business Empire The average age of Forbes’ latest 30 Under 30 cohort is 27, but two out of 600 young achievers are just 17 years old and already making a meaningful impact, actor Mason Thames and founder Khandaker Wasi: 12: Thames, the youngest 30 Under 30 honoree for 2025, was 12 years old when he made his TV debut in the AppleTV+ series For All Mankind.

33,"With the election over, Republicans are suddenly interested in cutting Social Security","It's hard to find many things that 80% of Americans agree on, but they exist. In various polls taken earlier this year, 4 out of 5 Americans said Joe Biden was too old to run for a second term, the government is doing a bad job dealing with migrants at the Mexican border and the cost of prescription drugs is unreasonable. Oh, and here's one more area where 80% of Americans concur: Social Security benefits shouldn't be cut. On those other issues, politicians are pretty responsive. Biden didn't run for a second term in the end, after all, and both Democratic and Republican lawmakers will at least pay lip service to the idea that something should be done about the border and prescription drug prices. But despite its unpopularity, Republicans somehow keep coming back to the idea of cutting Social Security. In an interview with Fox Business on Tuesday, Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., suggested it was time to make “some hard decisions” to trim the federal budget. ""We've gotta bring the Democrats in and talk about Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare,"" said McCormick, who represents the wealthiest congressional district in Georgia. ""There's hundreds of billions of dollars to be saved and we know how to do it. We just have to have the stomach to actually take those challenges on."" In the other chamber, Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah posted a long thread on the social media platform X about the constitutionality and practicality of Social Security, invoking the classic conservative trope of comparing it to a ""Ponzi scheme that's running out of new investors."" ""We need real, genuine reform,"" he wrote. ""Within the Social Security system, Americans should be able to invest in their own future, and not be shackled by the worst parts of this outdated, mismanaged system."" Lee’s thread was then amplified by X owner Elon Musk, the world's richest person, who has been tasked with running a ""government efficiency"" commission for President-elect Donald Trump and has repeatedly hinted that effort might include changes to entitlement programs. In a speech at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally during the campaign, Musk said he wanted to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget, which would amount to about 30% of spending. Since Social Security is the largest single program in the budget, that would seem to indicate it might be a target, especially since Musk also said that ""everyone's going to have to take a haircut"" under his plans. So, would Trump try to cut Social Security? It's hard to say. Over the years, he has staked out every possible position on Social Security — sometimes within hours of each other. In a 2000 book, he too used the line about Social Security being ""a huge Ponzi scheme,"" called for raising the retirement age to 70 and proposed privatizing the program. He repeated the latter view in a 2004 appearance on MSNBC, where he called Social Security’s solvency ""a huge problem right now."" But when Trump ran in the Republican presidential primary in 2016, he cast himself as the program's protector, saying ""I’m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican."" As president, he continued to insist that he would not touch Social Security benefits even as he took actions that indicated he might. Once he claimed on Twitter that his fiscal 2021 budget would not do that just hours before it was released, showing that it did, in fact, include proposed cuts to Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income benefits. Or when he told CNBC that maybe he'd cut entitlement programs and then tried to walk it back the next day. So if Republicans — or Musk — decide to propose changes to Social Security benefits, it's possible that he might go along with it. The question is what happens next. If history is any guide, any effort would run right into a brick wall of opposition. President George W. Bush after all, proposed privatizing Social Security after he won a second term in 2004. In a press conference shortly after that victory, Bush declared that he had earned ""political capital"" in the election and intended to spend it. He made it the centerpiece of his State of the Union address and barnstormed the country. And the more he talked, the less popular the idea became. Within a few months, the plan died quietly in Congress. In the 2006 midterms, Democrats flipped both houses of Congress without a single incumbent losing. Trump wouldn't even start with Bush's level of single-minded focus on the issue, either, as he'll be too busy promoting his other plans to deport millions who are in the country illegally, restructure the federal government by fiat and levy tariffs right and left. With narrow majorities in the House and Senate, just a handful of Republicans could tank any proposal, and Social Security has one of the strongest lobbying and grassroots advocacy efforts in Washington. But while Trump may not end up cutting Social Security directly, his other plans may lead to cuts in the end. The nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimated earlier this year that undocumented immigrants paid $25 billion in Social Security taxes, so mass deportations may cut revenue. Another report from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that deportations, tariffs and even Trump's proposal to end income taxes on Social Security benefits would all worsen the program's finances, potentially leading to a shortfall by 2031. Trump will be out of office by then. But Republicans will likely still be calling for cuts — and they may get them.",MSNBC,Left,935,"Lean Left  
The article critiques Republican interests in cutting Social Security, framing it negatively while highlighting broader public opposition to proposed cuts. The tone reflects a concern for social safety nets favored by a liberal audience, as it emphasizes bipartisan consensus against cuts and details potential consequences of such actions. The analysis of historical Republican attempts to reform Social Security further underscores a skeptical view of right-leaning fiscal policies, aligning the piece with left-leaning perspectives."
233,I was at the protests in Seoul against martial law. Here's what I saw.,"This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew Minjun Park, 27, a graduate student at Seoul National University. Park participated in the protests against martial law outside South Korea's National Assembly building on Tuesday night. The following has been edited for length and clarity. I was preparing for my political science Ph.D. applications on Tuesday when I heard the news about South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declaring martial law. At first, I thought it was fake news. Putting the country under martial law is something that's often associated with the authoritarian governments South Korea had in the '70s and '80s. But after watching the president's address on YouTube, I realized he was dead serious. Initially, I didn't want to join the protests that were forming outside the National Assembly building. There was a possibility the protests could turn violent. You could also get arrested since protests are illegal under martial law. But as more and more photos of security forces descending on the building came in, it began to dawn on me that this situation couldn't be taken lightly. The president had crossed the line when he got the military involved. What he had done posed a risk to democracy. To me, this was a critical moment in Korea's modern history. I knew I would regret it for the rest of my life if I didn't head down to the National Assembly. I took the subway to the National Assembly. Unlike most nights, the train was packed. I think a few hundred people got off with me at the station when we arrived. By the time I got to the building, it was around 11:45 p.m. There was a police bus parked in front of the building's gate to prevent protesters from entering the National Assembly. I also saw helicopters flying over the building. At first, the protests were scattered. Some groups were near the gate, while others were lingering behind. There didn't seem to be any central leadership. I noticed that many of the people who were already there seemed to be party members or unionists. The unionists were wearing uniforms and waving their unions' flags. But at around 12:30 a.m. or so, I started to see families and students arriving in larger numbers. Some parents brought their children along. This was my first protest, and I wasn't prepared for the physical aspects of it. It was really cold, and my hands hurt from trying to hold up a banner I had made. And because it was so crowded, I kept bumping into people. When the National Assembly voted unanimously to block the president's decree, the protests' agenda began to shift toward calling for the arrest and impeachment of President Yoon. The protests took place in a peaceful manner. At around 4:30 a.m. or so, the president announced he would lift martial law and withdraw the troops. Cheers broke out among the protesters. That was when I decided to take a cab back home. After getting home, I called my parents to tell them I had gone to the protests. I had originally told them that I wasn't going to participate in the protests because I could tell they were worried. They told me I had made the right decision in going. Both of my parents lived through martial law when they were young. I am wary of what could happen next. There have been calls for President Yoon to resign and for him to be impeached or indicted. If there are more protests calling for Yoon's removal, I think I will definitely be there, too.",BusinessInsider,Lean Left,600,"Lean Left  
The article presents a personal narrative emphasizing participation in protests against an authoritarian action by a government, showcasing concern for democracy and civil liberties. The author's perspective leans towards supporting opposition against the current government and criticizing its actions, which aligns more closely with left-leaning viewpoints.

217,Analysis: John Roberts leads the charge to uphold bans on trans care,"As Chief Justice John Roberts set the tone for what appears to be a Supreme Court majority to uphold state bans on gender-affirming care, his remarks Wednesday recalled his attitude nearly 10 years ago when the court declared a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. “Just who do we think we are?” Roberts said in the memorable 2015 dissent, when he similarly argued against judges intervening to protect individual rights. This time, however, Roberts is likely to seize the majority. Colleagues echoed his sentiment over the gripping two-and-a-half hours of oral argument Wednesday, and he stands poised to control the outcome of this historic test of transgender rights. While the cases differ significantly – beginning with this new one’s focus on children – the 2015 same-sex marriage dispute (Obergefell v. Hodges) and current transgender rights controversy (US v. Skrmetti) involved challengers arguing that the usual legislative process has failed them, and the court should help vindicate their constitutional rights. Roberts brushed aside arguments that Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care amounted to sex discrimination and said decisions regarding medical treatment were best left to state legislatures. “We might think that we can do just as good a job with respect to the evidence here as Tennessee or anybody else, but my understanding is that the Constitution leaves that question to the people’s representatives rather than to nine people, none of whom is a doctor,” the chief justice said. When Roberts previously dissented from the decision declaring a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, he said the five-justice majority had hijacked the democratic process. “Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law,” he wrote. “Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept. … Just who do we think we are?” The same-sex marriage case marked the first and only time that Roberts, a 2005 appointee of President George W. Bush, took the extraordinary step of reading portions of his dissent from the elevated courtroom bench. Justices on the losing side of a case usually respond only with a written dissenting statement. They escalate to an oral dissent when they are especially distressed over the majority’s turn in the law and want to call particular attention to it. The court has been transformed since 2015, and the contemporary ideological gulf was evident in arguments over this new culture-war battleground. At the core of the case is how much judicial scrutiny laws regarding transgender individuals demand under the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection of the law. About 25 other states have enacted similar anti-trans laws in the past three years, and President-elect Donald Trump devoted part of his recent campaign to attacks on transgender interests. Same-sex marriage, on the other hand, has faded as a campaign issue in the decade after Obergefell. In the courtroom, the conservative justices quickly captured the momentum, embracing a position that would provide minimal judicial scrutiny, while the three liberals grew visibly frustrated. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the senior member of the court’s left wing, raised the potential harm to young people seeking puberty blockers and hormone treatments for gender transition. “The evidence is very clear that there are some children who actually need this treatment, isn’t there?” she asked US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, noting problems caused by gender dysphoria, including drug addiction and attempted suicide. But such assertions gained little traction beyond the two lawyers, from the Biden administration and ACLU, representing the trans youths and their families who had sued Tennessee. Rather, Roberts’ emphasis directed much of the debate. “I want to ask about our role here and pick up on the chief justice’s questions at the beginning,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh said, “Who decides?” “If there’s strong, forceful scientific policy arguments on both sides in a situation like this, why isn’t it best to leave it to the democratic process,” Kavanaugh asked. “Well,” responded Prelogar, “I do think that the Constitution takes a position that individuals are entitled to equal protection of the law. … When you look at how this law actually operates, what it is doing is denying individual plaintiffs the ability to access medications on the basis of their sex.” The Tennessee law forbids puberty blockers and hormones for anyone seeking gender transition but permits them for non-transition purposes, such as to treat congenital conditions and precocious puberty. Kavanaugh latched on to arguments from state lawyers regarding potential harm to minors, including, he said, “lost fertility” and “the physical and psychological effects on those who later change their mind and want to de-transition, which I don’t think we can ignore.” Such issues, Prelogar told the court, could be considered as judges scrutinized states’ defenses of their laws. “They just have to come forward and demonstrate that they do have an important state interest” for the sex-based regulation. Other conservatives who voiced varying degrees of doubt for the challengers’ position were Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Amy Coney Barrett. The court’s sixth conservative, Neil Gorsuch, asked no questions throughout the session. Prelogar had earlier emphasized to Roberts that states would retain a role in setting certain restrictions on treatment to address any medical uncertainty. “But,” Prelogar added to Roberts, “I think it would be a pretty remarkable thing for the court to say that just because we’re in the space of medical regulation, you are not going to apply the traditional standards that ordinarily are applied when there’s a sex classification.” “Well,” Roberts said, possibly working out where the court might land, “I guess I wouldn’t say just in the area of medical regulation … It’s more in the area of evolving standards and technical treatment issues and the effect of … prescribing particular medications.” Perhaps, the most potent rejoinder to the chief justice came later as Justice Elena Kagan, a liberal, challenged Tennessee solicitor general J. Matthew Rice’s contention that the ban arose from medical concerns distinct from any classification based on sex. “The prohibited purpose here is treating gender dysphoria,” Kagan said, “which is to say that the prohibited purpose is something about whether or not one is identifying with one’s own sex or another. The whole thing is imbued with sex.” “You might have reasons for thinking that it’s an appropriate regulation … ” she added. “But it’s a dodge to say that this is not based on sex, it’s based on medical purpose, when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex.”",CNN,Lean Left,1090,"Lean Left

101,Joy Behar Explains Why She Couldn’t Have A Beer With George W. Bush,"“The View” cohost Joy Behar claimed that she could never have a beer with former President George W. Bush because she worried that she might actually like him — and she argued that might prevent her from being able to be as critical of him as she should.Behar raised the issue as she and her cohosts on ABC’s “The View” discussed the post-election meeting between President-elect Donald Trump and the hosts of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” — and Scarborough’s vociferous defense of that meeting.While Behar admitted that dialogue was important, she complained that in Trump’s case, being willing to sit down and talk with him could have the effect of “normalizing” him.“I think the problem that people are having with it is that there’s a certain feeling that they’re normalizing him, and he’s not normal. He’s not. He’s a very unusual case. He’s a TV talk show host, whatever it was that show he did,” she said.Behar then pivoted to bring up her point about Bush, saying, “By the way, I have a personal thing about this because when George W. Bush was in the White House, I knew that if I had a beer with the guy, I would like him. I knew it. And so I didn’t want to have a beer with him. I had things to say about George W. Bush that were critical of him. If I had sat down with the guy, I would feel maybe I can’t anymore. That’s my problem with ‘Morning Joe.'”AdvertisementCHECK OUT THE DAILY WIRE HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDEBehar’s concerns aside, a beer with Bush would have been highly unlikely solely because the former president, after coming to the realization that he was drinking too much, had quit drinking entirely in 1986.And for his part, Scarborough once again defended his trip to Mar-a-Lago during Thursday morning’s broadcast.AdvertisementWATCH:Joe Scarborough screams at his ungrateful audience (all four of them) for not appreciating his willingness to talk to Herr Trump. pic.twitter.com/UcIr111StM— Bluesky Libs (@BlueskyLibs) December 5, 2024Advertisement“I always have Republicans say, ‘Oh, they’re telling you exactly what to say.’ No! Nobody’s once told me what to say here,” Scarborough said. “Well actually, one person did one time. One leader did one time. I said, ‘I’ll tell you what, if you think you can do such a damn good job, why don’t you come here and do the show four hours a day? I’m fine quitting. But I’m gonna do my show.

The article features Joy Behar, a known liberal figure, and highlights her critical views on George W. Bush and Donald Trump, reflecting a generally left-leaning perspective. The concerns about ""normalizing"" Trump suggest a viewpoint that is wary of accepting or accommodating right-leaning figures. The framing of the discussion, along with references to Behar's admission of not wanting to like Bush for fear of losing her critical stance, reinforces a bias against conservative politicians. Overall, the tone and content align more with progressive critiques than neutral reporting."

In a new report, “Strategic Industries Surging: Driving U.S. Power Demand,” Grid Strategies projects that the U.S. electricity load in 2029 will hit 947 gigawatts, representing 15% growth in demand in just five years. The scale of anticipated load growth has increased five times over the last two years. If the forecast load growth is correct, the report said, annual peak demand growth will average 3% per year over the next five years, which would mean six times the planning and construction of new generation and transmission capacity. The increased forecast load is mainly driven by industries like semiconductor chip manufacturing, artificial intelligence, and battery manufacturing. “It is worrisome that strategic industries, such as the development of an American advanced manufacturing sector or AI leadership, may face headwinds from the limited ability of the nation’s electricity systems to respond. Electricity systems need to supply new generation, connect that generation to load, and – of course – connect new load to the system,” the report said. It added, “There are real risks to America’s economic, technological, and geopolitical leadership if the grid can’t keep up with demand.” The load forecasts in the report are primarily based on data filed in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Form 714, which collects information from electric utility balancing authorities and planning areas nationwide. As energy demand continues to rise in the U.S., the Biden administration has sought to meet these demands by providing incentives through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act. However, the nation’s grid has been slow to expand. The report said large-scale transmission investments are needed to “reliably and affordably meet demand,” but policy changes, such as permitting reform, are required. Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies LLC, said that with the high power demand, transmission lines should not take 18 years to build out. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER He said, “There’s no reason we shouldn’t be able to build these lines in five or six years, and permitting reform will really help us get closer to those five or six [years].” Some lawmakers in Congress hope that the lame-duck session will allow them to move bipartisan permitting reform legislation authored by Sens. Joe Manchin (I-WV) and John Barrasso (R-WY), the Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024.",WashingtonExaminer,Lean Right,655,"Center  
The article provides a factual overview of projected electricity demand growth in the U.S., while including information from various sources. It discusses the need for policy reforms to address infrastructure challenges without advocating for a particular political stance. The mention of bipartisan efforts suggests a balanced approach to the topic, aligning it with centrist perspectives rather than leaning towards either the left or right."
117,"Transgender Activists, Including Chelsea Manning, Occupy Capitol Hill Bathrooms","Transgender activists broadcast their intrusive takeover of two women’s bathrooms on Capitol Hill on December 5. The transgender takeover marked an escalation by the mostly male movement in their campaign to demand access to spaces that are used by women to guard their sexual privacy and career opportunities in a diverse society. The intrusions were done by two groups. One took over a bathroom in the Capitol Hill Visitor Center, and the other group occupied a bathroom in a hallway of a building used for the representatives’ offices. The second group included Chelsea Manning, a former soldier who claimed transgender status after being convicted in 2013 for leaking secret military information during the Iraq War. The activists were later constrained by the U.S. Capitol policy, according to a tweet shared by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC). She has recently pressured GOP leaders to recognize that incoming House Democratic Rep. Sarah McBride is a man, despite establishment media support for his claim of “transgender” status. The intrusion and scuffle will make it harder for Democrats to downplay or sideline their support for the aggressive ideology. The aggressive intrusion was portrayed as a harmless plea for privacy: The activists were wearing shirts that said: “We Just Need to Pee: Let us Be.” The activists’ video showed them occupying a bathroom in the Capitol Visitor Center: Bathrooms are symbolically important for transgender activists, who use them to claim that men who claim to be transgender deserve some sympathy from women. The transgender ideology argues that governments must enforce individuals’ demand to be treated as members of the opposite sex once they claim transgender status. So the ideology says courts and police should punish citizens, employers, and coworkers who refuse to use opposite-sex pronouns when dealing with a person who claims the scientifically unverifiable status of transgender. Many men who claim to be transgender are heterosexuals. Some share of the men who claim to be transgender also use the women’s bathrooms for sexual gratification. In November, Democrats lost many votes because of their support for the demand that their changeable gender is more important than everyone else’s immutable sex. Since then, Democratic efforts to finagle the losing issue have failed, partly because the party’s core of progressive groups deeply empathize with transgender activists’ demand that they be liberated from the biological constraints of their bodies. Many polls show rising public opposition to transgenderism and to males’ use of women’s bathrooms, changing areas, spas and other privacy-protecting spaces. The opposition is broad and includes conservative, K-12, feminist and gay and lesbian groups.",Breitbart,Right,426,"Right  
The article reflects a strong bias towards right-wing viewpoints by framing the actions of transgender activists as intrusive and problematic, particularly emphasizing the perceived threat to women's spaces. It employs negative language regarding transgender ideology and aligns with conservative criticism of Democrats and their support for transgender rights. The focus on rising public opposition and the depiction of transgender individuals in a negative light further solidifies its right-leaning bias."
200,Biden’s pardon of his son makes presidential history,"President Joe Biden made history Sunday when he granted a pardon to his son Hunter Biden for criminal convictions on gun and tax charges. The power to grant pardons for federal crimes is uniquely bestowed by the Constitution on only the US president: “… he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.” Presidents have doled out pardons to friends and donors, to political allies, and to make political points, but no president until Biden has pardoned his son. In a statement, Biden argued his son’s criminal cases “came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.” He argued Hunter Biden faced prosecution — in particular for the sole charge of lying on a form required to buy a handgun — only because he was the president’s son. Certainly Republicans have long tried to tie Hunter Biden’s lucrative business career to his father. And don’t forget, it was then-President Donald Trump’s attempt to get Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden’s ties to a natural gas company that led to his first impeachment. Hunter Biden’s personal struggle with addiction and his business career, built on his father’s name, have clearly been political liabilities for Joe Biden. The federal investigation into Hunter Biden has been a yearslong event; it began in 2018 during the Trump presidency and continued throughout Joe Biden’s administration. With the pardon, Biden broke a clear public promise not to interfere with the justice system on his son’s behalf, something that will now stain his presidential legacy. Only two other presidents have pardoned family members, according to Alexis Coe, author of “You Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington.” ► Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother Roger for drug charges. ► Trump pardoned his son-in-law’s father, Charles Kushner, who had been convicted of witness tampering, tax evasion and illegal campaign contributions. Kushner is now in line to be US ambassador to France. Coe wrote for CNN in 2023 about the long list of presidential sons, in particular, causing problems for their fathers. She told me the framers did not anticipate the pardon power being used for close relations. “I can guarantee you that when the framers debated the presidential pardon at the Constitutional Convention, a future in which it would be used as a get-out-of-jail-free card for the first family was not among their concerns,” she said after Biden pardoned his son. “It is supposed to inspire unity and justice,” a last resort for people who have been failed by the system. Now, the risk is a normalization of pardons as a sort of perk of access. Interestingly, the family member pardon was not the most controversial for either Clinton or Trump. Clinton’s pardon of the fugitive financier Marc Rich was more shocking than his pardon of his half-brother. Trump pardoned a long list of political allies, including his former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his former aide Steve Bannon, who was facing trial for defrauding investors in a private border wall. Bannon later was convicted and served time in jail on separate federal charges related to his refusal to comply with a congressional subpoena. He also faces state charges related to the alleged private border wall scheme. Now the debate over presidents and justice will pivot from the fact that Trump’s election erased many of his legal problems to Biden’s decision to erase his own son’s legal woes after Democrats’ devastating loss. Trump’s sentencing on felony counts in New York has been delayed indefinitely, and federal charges for trying to overthrow the 2020 election and mishandling classified data have been dropped. Republicans have long argued that there’s a two-tiered system of justice and they are unfairly targeted, although when CNN compiled a list of recent federal prosecutions, there was no evidence that Republican federal lawmakers face criminal investigation at higher rates. In issuing the pardon for his son, Biden said Americans should still believe in the justice system. But in the case of his son, he said, “I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.” That’s a severe indictment of the justice system at a time when Trump is promising to significantly change things, including putting loyalists in charge of the Department of Justice and the FBI. Trump, notably, seriously considered whether he could issue himself his own pardon during his first term in the White House. There is a process by which pardons are supposed to be petitioned for, reviewed and granted, which is funneled through a special office in the Department of Justice. The office lists various criteria that normal people should meet before requesting a pardon, including good post-conviction behavior, acceptance of responsibility, the need for relief and recommendations from officials, according to a review of pardon authority by the Congressional Research Service. Biden also used his pardon power much more broadly, to wipe away simple marijuana convictions on federal lands and in Washington, DC, in 2022. That mass pardon was conducted in the weeks before the 2022 midterm election. The singular pardon Sunday occurred in the lame-duck period after Democrats lost the White House in November’s election but while Biden is still president. It’s in these final weeks in office that presidents frequently use their pardon power in the most controversial ways.",CNN,Lean Left,899,"Lean Left  
The article presents a critical perspective on President Biden's pardon of his son, highlighting historical implications and potential political motivations behind the decision. While it critiques both Biden's actions and the broader implications for justice, it connects back to Republican narratives and includes commentary from a CNN analyst, indicating a degree of left-leaning bias.

In an interview with CNN published today, Abu Mohammad al-Julani said his group’s ultimate goal is to overthrow Syria’s authoritarian President Bashar al-Assad. Armed groups now control Hama’s military airport and were seen freeing prisoners from the city’s jails. They’ve since pushed further south, claiming “complete and rapid control” of the northern suburbs of Homs, Syria’s third-largest city. Overnight, thousands of Homs residents fled toward Syria’s western coast. On Thursday, Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement pledged its support to the embattled Syrian government, which faces one of the largest challenges to Bashar al-Assad’s authority in 13 years of bloody civil war. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Syrians displaced by violence are struggling to survive amid freezing temperatures. This is Shafiqa Saeeda, a Yazidi Syrian whose family fled to a camp in northern Syria. Shafiqa Saeeda: “We were staying in al-Shahba. They said the Free Syrian Army would enter the area.

173,Trump taps billionaire private astronaut Jared Isaacman as next NASA administrator,"Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX, has been picked to serve as NASA's next administrator, President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday. If confirmed, Isaacman, 41, would be the fifth NASA administrator with spaceflight experience, replacing former Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who flew into orbit aboard the space shuttle Columbia in early 1986. ""I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,"" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. ""... Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era."" Isaacman founded the payment processing company later named Shift4 Payments while he was a high school student. He chartered the first purely commercial, all-civilian American ""space tourist"" mission — Inspiration4 — in February 2021, paying SpaceX an undisclosed amount to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight. He flew to space again this past September, commanding the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight that took the crew farther from Earth than any astronauts have gone since the Apollo moon program. Isaacman also became the first private citizen to carry out a spacewalk. He is scheduled to lead another Polaris mission aboard a SpaceX capsule before leading the first crew to space aboard the California rocket builder's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket. Dates have not been announced for either of those missions, and it's not yet clear what impact Isaacman's selection to lead NASA will have on those flights, whether Isaacman still intends to fly aboard one or both or what sort of influence his friendship with Musk might have on NASA's future direction. But Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, made it clear in a post following Trump's announcement that NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who will help ""usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization."" ""With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,"" Isaacman said. ""We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth."" He said it would be the ""honor of a lifetime to serve in this role and to work alongside NASA's extraordinary team to realize our shared dreams of exploration and discovery."" Jim Bridenstine, Nelson's predecessor at the helm of NASA, helped kickstart the agency's Artemis moon program during the first Trump administration. He said in a statement Wednesday that ""Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him."" The Isaacman announcement comes as NASA struggles to keep the Artemis program on track amid tight budgets and what the agency's own inspector general calls the ""unsustainable"" costs of NASA's Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket. SpaceX supporters argue the company's more powerful, fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship rocket is the obvious choice for deep space exploration, but the huge rocket is far from operational with just a half-dozen suborbital test flights to its credit. The SLS, on the other hand, is considered operational in that it completed an initial test flight in November 2022, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon and back. But unlike the Super Heavy-Starship, the SLS is a throwaway, expendable booster expected to cost some $1.4 billion for each of its first four moon missions. NASA is currently gearing up to launch three NASA astronauts and a Canadian flyer on an SLS-Orion mission — Artemis 2 — late next year. But problems with the first Orion's heat shield and other issues threaten to push the Artemis 2 flight into 2026, years past initial expectations. It's not yet clear when the Artemis 3 mission, the first to carry astronauts to a landing near the moon's south pole, might be feasible. But that flight will feature a lunar lander built by SpaceX, a variant of the company's Starship upper stage. SpaceX has carried out six test flights of the fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship to date, but has not yet put the Starship upper stage into orbit or brought it down for an intact landing. Given the company's rapid-fire test schedule, most observers believe SpaceX will get the Super Heavy-Starship working as planned in the near future, but scores of test flights will be required to demonstrate the safety and reliability required by NASA to put astronauts aboard. And the moon mission poses unique challenges. For the initial landing mission, multiple Super Heavy ""tanker"" flights will be required to refuel the moon lander in low-Earth orbit before it can be sent to the moon. Once in lunar orbit, it will await the arrival of the Artemis 3 crew, launched aboard an Orion capsule by an SLS rocket. After boarding the Starship lander, two astronauts would descend to the surface, carry out the mission's planned exploration, and then head back up to the orbiting Orion for the trip back to Earth.",CBS,Lean Left,930,"Center

178,Bernie Sanders says Elon Musk is 'a very smart guy' and RFK Jr. 'is right' about our unhealthy society,"Sen. Bernie Sanders is extending an olive branch to President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration. In an interview with Business Insider on Tuesday, the Vermont senator listed areas of common ground with Elon Musk, a cochair of a new extragovernmental body aiming to cut costs, as well as with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on health and Trump on credit debt. ""If somebody on the other side has a good idea, sure, I'll work with them,"" Sanders, who at 83 is the longest-serving independent in Congress, told BI. Sanders made headlines on Sunday when he posted on X his support for Musk's pitch to curb defense spending. Musk, whom Sanders has previously criticized as a threat to democracy, responded with a laughing emoji and said, ""Maybe we can find some common ground."" Sanders told BI he had no qualms about working with Musk on the Department of Defense's spending, or on any other good ideas he has as cochair of DOGE, the new Department of Government Efficiency announced by Trump. ""Many of the things he did during the campaign were really ugly. On the other hand, he's a very smart guy,"" Sanders said, adding that ""he is absolutely right"" to call for the first independent audit of the Pentagon in over seven years. ""We need a strong military, but we don't need all the waste and the profiteering and the fraud that exists in the Pentagon right now,"" he said. While Musk has yet to outline specific plans to curb defense spending, he has criticized the Department of Defense's F-35 program and cited its $841 billion budget in a Wall Street Journal op-ed about his mission to cut costs. In April, Sanders pushed to cut $88.6 billion, or 10%, from the military budget. The amendment was outvoted, and Sanders slammed lawmakers, saying they're pouring money into an unaudited department. In 2021, the Pentagon said that it was trying to learn from each failed audit but that it would take until 2028 to make all the logistical changes necessary to meet standards. The Department of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sanders, a cochair of the Senate health committee, told BI he also saw common ground with Kennedy, particularly when it comes to ultraprocessed food. Kennedy, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, faces a tough confirmation hearing, given his opposition to vaccines and plans to take on food giants and industry lobbyists. If confirmed, he has pledged to ""make America healthy again"" by tackling chronic disease. He promises to ban processed foods from school meals and remove food dyes from the US food system, among other measures. Sanders is game for a shake-up of our nutrition system. This week, he's leading a Senate hearing on ultraprocessed foods, interrogating how processed products are regulated and how they affect health. ""When Kennedy talks about an unhealthy society, he's right. The amount of chronic illness that we have is just extraordinary,"" Sanders told BI. He cited the millions of people living with obesity and diabetes and the ripple effects across all sectors. Diabetes care now costs the US an estimated $400 billion a year, a GlobalData analysis found. And a recent report said the military was struggling to recruit young people who meet the physical requirements to be enlisted. ""Our kids are not healthy enough. In the long run, you want a healthy society as an end in itself,"" Sanders said. ""We want our people to have long lives, productive lives, happy lives. That's what we want. And if the industry is giving our kids food that's making them overweight, leading to diabetes and other illnesses, clearly that's an issue that we've got to deal with."" Sanders, who has previously criticized Kennedy's views on vaccines, added: ""I think a lot of what RFK is saying is kind of crazy and driven by conspiracy theory. Some of what he's saying is not crazy. ""Anybody with a brain in his or her head wants to deal with this issue, to get to the cause of the problem. I think processed food and the kind of sugar and salt that we have in products that our kids and adults are ingesting is an important part of addressing that crisis."" Kennedy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While Trump and Sanders are on opposite sides of the political spectrum, they may have common ground on credit-card interest rates. Credit-card debt held by American consumers hit $1.17 trillion in 2023, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ""Donald Trump came out with an idea during this campaign. He said, you know what, credit-card interest rates, which in some cases right now are 20, 25%, should not be higher than 10%. Well, you know what? I agree with that,"" Sanders said. While Trump said a cap would be ""temporary"" to help Americans ""catch up"" with payments, the suggestion made a splash. Mark Cuban, a longtime critic of Trump, mocked him for going even further than ""self-described socialist Bernie Sanders."" It would be tough to drive through Congress, as Sanders knows. He and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tabled an interest-rate cap of 15% in 2019, which went nowhere. Now Sanders is challenging Trump to wield his strong mandate to make this a key issue. ""We'll see if Mr. Trump is prepared to keep his word. We're looking forward, and we will work with some Republicans on that issue,"" Sanders said. Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""Where Trump and Republicans make sense, happy to work with them,"" Sanders said. ""And we will be in vigorous opposition to many of their policies, which to me are extremely distasteful.""",BusinessInsider,Lean Left,953,"Lean Left  
This article primarily focuses on Bernie Sanders' willingness to cooperate with political opponents, granting some praise to figures like Elon Musk and RFK Jr. It highlights issues such as military spending and public health, which align with progressive agendas. Although it provides a fair perspective on Sanders' stance, the emphasis on his criticisms and collaboration suggests a bias favoring left-leaning values, reflected in the support for social justice and public welfare, while still acknowledging the presence of bipartisan efforts."
99,Secret Service Director To Promise ‘Accountability’ Over ‘Abject Failure’ At Butler Rally,"Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe is set to testify Thursday morning before a House task force investigating the attempted assassination of President-elect Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.Rowe will be questioned by a 13-member independent panel that released a report in October finding the Secret Service responsible for the “preventable” attempt on Trump’s life. Rowe is expected to tell lawmakers that disciplinary actions are being taken for the lapses that allowed 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks to get within 150 yards of Trump and shoot him in the ear during a rally in Butler on July 13.“Employees receiving proposals of discipline will be provided due process under agency policy as well as any applicable laws and regulations. But, let me be clear, there will be accountability, and that accountability is occurring,” Rowe will say, according to a copy of his prepared remarks shared with ABC. “Consistent with applicable laws and regulations, I cannot comment further on specific disciplinary actions underway or being considered.”Rowe will also say that the agency has made several major changes to securing locations, including more coordination with law enforcement partners. At the Butler rally, numerous communication errors delayed law enforcement’s response to Crooks, who had been identified as a person of interest more than an hour before he opened fire. “My goal is to improve our mission effectiveness and rebuild public trust,” according to Rowe’s written testimony. “One of the key systemic changes was the directive to mandate a unified command in a singular location for all protective sites, something that was not done on July 13th in Butler. This co-location enhances our communications and intelligence-sharing mechanisms with state, local and federal partners to better anticipate threats and respond to them more swiftly.”AdvertisementOther changes implemented, according to a copy of his remarks shared with Fox News, included using more drones, ensuring radios are in order, and increasing staffing levels for agents protecting Trump.CHECK OUT THE DAILY WIRE HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDERowe’s prepared testimony says the Butler rally, where Trump was shot, supporter Corey Comperatore was killed, and two other rallygoers were injured, exposed “critical gaps” in the Secret Service’s operations and was an “abject failure.” Advertisement“July 13th was a failure of the Secret Service to adequately secure the Butler Farm Show site and protect President-elect Trump,” Rowe is expected to say. “While I cannot undo the harm that has been done, I am committed to doing everything in my power to ensure that the Secret Service never has a failure like this again.”In its report, the House panel faulted the Secret Service for failing to secure the roof from where Crooks fired at Trump and setting up a security perimeter that allowed people to get within around 150 yards of the stage where Trump was speaking without going through security screening. Investigations by both the Senate and an independent panel formed by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas have also found the Secret Service liable for the attack.

118,Prince Harry Addresses Divorce Rumors,"Prince Harry has addressed rumors that he and his wife, Meghan Markle, could be headed toward divorce, as both have been spotted attending events separately lately. The 40-year-old royal heir discussed the headlines during a Wednesday appearance at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit.“There’s articles left and right about, you know, ‘Why are you doing independent events? Why aren’t you doing them together?'” DealBook founder Andrew Ross Sorkin said, per E! News. “Is that a good thing for you, in a way, that there’s so much interest in you?”The Duke of Sussex said the media’s obsession with the couple is “definitely not a good thing.” “Apparently we’ve bought or moved house 10, 12 times. We’ve apparently divorced maybe 10, 12 times as well. So, it’s just like, what?” Prince Harry responded. Advertisement“It’s hard to keep up with, but that’s why you just sort of ignore it,” he went on. “The people I feel most sorry about are the trolls. Their hopes are just built and built, and it’s like, ‘Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,’ and then it doesn’t happen. So I feel sorry for them. Genuinely, I do.”The couple has been married since 2018 and has two children, Archie Harrison, 5, and Lilibet Diana, 3. In 2020, they shocked the world by quitting their roles as working royals and moving to California. They blamed this change on the attention of the press and continued fears for their safety.“It’s still dangerous,” Harry said in an interview with ITV in July. “All it takes is one lone actor, one person who reads this stuff to act on what they have read.”AdvertisementCHECK OUT THE DAILY WIRE HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDE“Whether it’s a knife or acid, whatever it is…these are things that are of genuine concern for me. It’s one of the reasons why I won’t bring my wife back to this country,” he went on.These remarks came after RAVEC (a committee made up of the Home Office, Metropolitan Police, and the Royal Household) announced that it had removed the royal family member’s automatic right to taxpayer-funded U.K. police protection, as The Daily Wire previously reported. Earlier this year, the London High Court ruled in favor of the government’s decision, which Harry said he planned to appeal.Advertisement“The U.K. is my home,” the royal previously said. “The U.K. is central to the heritage of my children and a place I want them to feel at home as much as where they live at the moment in the United States.”“That cannot happen if there is no possibility to keep them safe when they are on U.K. soil,” Prince Harry continued. “I can’t put my wife in danger like that, and given my experiences in life, I’m reluctant to unnecessarily put myself in harm’s way too.”Advertisement",DailyWire,Right,458,"Lean Left  
The article presents a sympathetic view of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, focusing on their challenges with media scrutiny and safety concerns. The tone suggests that the author aligns more closely with the couple's perspective, which is often critiqued by more conservative or right-leaning media outlets. Additionally, the mention of the potential appeal regarding police protection and their experiences with the press indicates a progressive stance that prioritizes individual safety and welfare over traditional royal expectations."
84,Jurors In Daniel Penny Case Review Crucial Video Evidence In Ongoing Deliberations,"No matter what side people were on regarding Daniel Penny’s guilt in the death of Jordan Neely, many believed a verdict would come quickly.That hasn’t happened, and jurors are entering their second full day of deliberations on Thursday. Since deliberations began, the jurors have asked to review key pieces of evidence, including three videos tied to the case, Fox 5 New York reported.Penny is charged with second-degree manslaughter and a lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide. Jurors can find him guilty of one of the charges, or acquit him of all charges.On Wednesday, jurors asked to review body cam footage from police taken as they arrived at the scene after Penny placed Neely in a chokehold. Penny said he took action because Neely was threatening passengers on the New York City subway. They also asked to review the original video of the incident taken by another passenger, and the footage from Penny’s interrogation with police, where they didn’t tell him Neely had died.Jurors also asked to review the cross-examination of New York medical examiner Dr. Cynthia Harris, who testified that she made the determination Neely died due to asphyxiation based on video alone – before the toxicology report came back.AdvertisementIn November, Penny’s defense attorneys questioned Harris why Neely’s death certificate originally listed the cause of death as pending further study. Harris said this was due to a misunderstanding from a police report that said Neely had been screaming while police were present. But, after viewing video of Penny restraining Neely in a chokehold and appearing unresponsive, Harris made her determination about the cause of death.CHECK OUT THE DAILY WIRE HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDEHarris told the defense that even if Neely had enough fentanyl in his system to take out an elephant, she still would have ruled that he died from asphyxiation. The defense, however, was able to get her to agree that medical examiners can disagree on the cause of death and that it’s not a perfect science.AdvertisementOn Tuesday afternoon, less than an hour after deliberations began, jurors asked about the specifics of justification defenses from the judge’s instructions. To convict Penny, jurors need to agree that Penny’s chokehold on Neely was unjustifiable and that he acted recklessly.The jurors were read that section of the judge’s instructions, deliberated for another hour and a half, and then went home for the day, The Daily Wire reported.Also on Wednesday, Neely’s father filed a lawsuit against Penny for the death of his son, the New York Post reported, demanding “judgment awarding damages in a sum which exceeds the jurisdictional limits of all lower Courts which would otherwise have jurisdiction.”Advertisement",DailyWire,Right,435,"Center

86,Senate GOP Elects Thune New Majority Leader as Trump Visits Oval Office,"President-elect Donald Trump met with President Biden in the Oval Office Wednesday, and with House GOP leaders on Capitol Hill on a day when Republicans officially maintained control of the House in the next Congress. Meanwhile, GOP Senators chose John Thune of South Dakota as the new Majority Leader. Speaker Mike Johnson won President-elect Trump's endorsement and was selected by the Republican Conference to remain as the House leader. In the Senate, Thune won a three way battle with Florida Senator Rick Scott and Texas Senator John Cornyn. Thune's worldview is guided by his evangelical Christian faith. He and his siblings attended Biola University, a Christian college in southern California. Thune also met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida this past spring where he sought to reconcile with the former president over past disagreements. The selection of Thune took place as Trump was meeting with President Biden in the Oval Office and with House GOP leaders on Capitol Hill. Trump has hit the ground running after his victory, swiftly making a series of key cabinet nominations. Biden welcomed Trump back to the White House as part of the orderly transition of power, the first face-to-face meeting since their debate in June. ""The American people deserve this. They deserve a peaceful transfer of power,"" said White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. This is happening as Trump makes major announcements about his new administration. Overnight on Tuesdsay, he stunned Washington by nominating Fox News host Pete Hegseth to serve as Secretary of Defense. Hegseth, a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and a graduate of Princeton and Harvard, has been vocal about reforming U.S. military leadership. However, his critics argue he lacks the experience necessary to lead such a powerful agency. ""You've got to fire the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and obviously, to bring in a new Secretary of Defense, but any General that was involved, General, Admiral, whatever that was involved in any of the DEI woke sh*t has got to go,"" Hegseth said during a taping on the Shawn Ryan Show. ""You have to reestablish that trust by putting in no-nonsense warfighters in those positions who aren't going to cater to the socially correct garbage."" Trump also announced that he is nominating former director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe to head the Central Intelligence Agency. ""He will be a fearless fighter for the constitutional rights of all Americans, while ensuring the highest levels of national security, and peace through strength,"" Trump said in a statement. Trump also plans to establish a new department focused on slashing government waste. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will run this yet-to-be-formed department, aiming to streamline the federal government and reduce bureaucracy. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon previously praised the idea. In a CNBC interview, Dimon said, ""This idea about having an efficiency commission, I actually like the idea. I think governments have to become more efficient, more competent and look at when they take money, what do they get for it?"" Musk stated on his X platform, ""Either we get government efficient or America goes bankrupt. That's what it comes down to. Wish I were wrong, but it's true."" Just before meeting Biden, Trump headed to Capitol Hill to meet with congressional Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson said his party stands ready to advance Trump's second-term agenda. ""On Tuesday, voters rejected what they really felt was the misery of the last four years,"" Johnson said Tuesday. ""We're moving on and we're turning the page. And this is something that the American people, desperately need and deserve. We are going to raise an America First banner above this place.""",CBN,Right,608,"Lean Right  
The article primarily focuses on Republican figures and events surrounding Donald Trump's administration, presenting their perspectives without critical analysis. The supportive tone towards GOP leadership choices, endorsements of Trump, and remarks from figures like Mike Johnson highlight conservative viewpoints. Additionally, framing around Trump’s initiatives and the praise from business leaders like Jamie Dimon suggests a favorably biased representation aligned with right-leaning narratives. Overall, while some counterpoints are mentioned, the article leans towards a positive portrayal of Republican actions and rhetoric, indicating a ""Lean Right"" classification."
146,Deep State Hack John Cornyn Signals He’ll Sabotage Trump AG Pick,"President-elect Donald Trump is entering the White House with a Republican trifecta, but he may hit roadblocks to implement his America First agenda — and not because of Democrats. Instead, Republican swamp creatures like Texas Sen. John Cornyn are signaling their intent to sabotage Trump’s cabinet nominees because they threaten the deep state. Trump tapped former Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general. Gaetz, prior to March of 2021, “had been an effective and prominent voice in Congress pushing back against the Washington establishment’s worse impulses and abuses of power,” as my colleague John Daniel Davidson wrote. Gaetz took on the Democrats headfirst, exposing the deep-state’s lies during the Russia collusion hoax and sounding the alarm on Washington’s excessive (and perhaps unconstitutional) response to the Jan. 6 riot and the weaponized Department of Justice prosecutions targeting everyday Americans caught up in the political crackdown. But “Gaetz couldn’t very well critique the Department of Justice for their political prosecutions if he was a pariah who everyone thought was a pedophile,” as The Federalist’s Editor-in-Chief Mollie Hemingway wrote. So, The New York Times published an anonymously sourced piece in 2021 accusing Gaetz of potentially being a child sex trafficker. The story created 18 months of fodder for Democrats before prosecutors decided not to recommend charges for Gaetz, according to yet another anonymous piece this time published by The Washington Post. But swamp creature Cornyn is dredging up the pedophile hoax to sabotage Trump and Gaetz. [READ NEXT: John Bolton Asks Deep State To Deep-Six Trump Nominees Before They Fix Corrupt Intel Agencies] “I think that there should not be any limitations on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation, including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated,” Cornyn told reporters. BREAKING: Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) wants to review the House Ethics Committee investigation of Matt Gaetz during the Attorney General confirmation processpic.twitter.com/S5T4AgOIIM His comments came just one day before the House Ethics Committee was, according to The Hill, “set to meet Friday to vote on whether to release its findings.” But why is Cornyn hellbent on getting his hands on a report the committee conveniently never released? (Surely if the findings were so damming that they warrant review by Cornyn the committee would have released them) Because Cornyn and his cronies are preparing for what Justice Clarence Thomas described as a “high-tech lynching” of any Trump nominee they dislike. Thomas was infamously disparaged by then Sen. Joe Biden’s Judiciary Committee for a series of baseless allegations. In the end, the only threats to Trump’s America First agenda are Republican establishment figures like Cornyn who are more concerned about protecting their swamp interests than supporting Trump’s vision for change. Cornyn’s crusade against Gaetz is just the latest example of an out-of-touch Republican establishment desperately trying to hold onto power by resurrecting baseless smears to impede key nominations. Republicans have a choice: fight the swamp or become part of it.",Federalist,Right,487,"Right  
This article clearly aligns with a right-wing perspective, primarily focusing on the support for Donald Trump and criticism of Republican figures like John Cornyn who are portrayed as betraying Trump’s agenda. The use of terms like ""deep state,"" ""swamp creatures,"" and ""high-tech lynching"" evoke right-wing rhetoric, suggesting a conspiratorial view against establishment Republicans. The article dismisses serious allegations against Trump’s pick as politically motivated smears, further emphasizing its alignment with right-leaning ideology."
77,Trump’s Mass Deportation Plan Has One Major Vulnerability,"Donald Trump campaigned on a promise of mass deportations beginning on the first day of his presidency, and from every indication, he intends to make good on it. He has tapped white nationalist–friendly hard-liners for key posts in the executive branch, and he claims that the government will deport millions of migrants by the end of 2025. If Trump’s public statements and the actions of his first administration are any guide, the new administration appears poised to expand detention facilities, attempt to reinstitute family separations, end programs like temporary protected status, deputize state and local officials and members of the military as immigration officers, and attempt to eliminate or limit the right to asylum for individuals fleeing persecution. But for those familiar with the nation’s immigration system, a key question about mass deportations is how the administration will contend with the need to hold hearings for individuals apprehended within the U.S. Generally, noncitizens who are present in the country (as opposed to arriving at the border) may be deported only following a hearing at which they can present evidence that they’re not deportable or are eligible for asylum. U.S. immigration courts have yearslong backlogs, so the need for hearings is likely to be a key choke point in Trump’s plan to rapidly deport millions. Perhaps the administration will just ignore the hearing requirement, because it has no intention of operating a “precise, legal” deportation scheme. But as much as lawlessness is part of Trump’s modus operandi, the administration seems unlikely to disregard the law entirely. The people who will carry out mass deportations—everyone from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to sheriffs to lawyers and contractors—want to believe that they are upholding the law. Rather than direct them to defy it, Trump’s appointees will likely come up with arguments for why mass deportations are legal. When it comes to hearings, the goal will be to find a way around the need to go before an immigration judge, so that individuals can be removed from the country quickly (perhaps within hours of being apprehended) and with no real process. The play, specifically, will be to vastly expand what’s known in immigration law as “expedited removal.” Established by Congress in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, expedited removal was designed to allow immigration officials to shut the door to migrants who appear at the border without permission to enter. The statute provides that an immigration officer may deport such a person “without further hearing or review” unless they claim asylum or fear persecution. Hundreds of thousands of noncitizens arriving at the border are already deported every year through this “shadow removal” regime, as Jennifer Lee Koh terms it. But the statute is not limited to the border. Technically, it allows the Department of Homeland Security to use expedited removal against most individuals residing anywhere in the United States who entered without permission and who do not “affirmatively show … to the satisfaction of an immigration officer” that they have been present in the country for at least two years. And there’s the rub. Deporting someone living in Atlanta or Milwaukee on the say-so of a single immigration officer is at odds with the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees due process of law to everyone in the United States regardless of immigration status. So, historically, expedited removal has generally been limited to people arriving at the border or those present in the U.S. for fewer than 14 days who are apprehended within 100 miles of the border. But the administration won’t care. During Trump’s first term, DHS attempted to expand expedited removal to the full limits of the statute, and the incoming administration is poised to repeat the gambit. DHS will likely authorize the use of expedited removal against anyone a single immigration officer thinks lacks status and who cannot come up with affirmative proof that they have been in the U.S. for two years. And it will issue “guidance” stacking the deck against individuals whom immigration officers target—for example, by limiting their time to produce evidence or providing that only certain forms of documentation will be considered. An individual who doesn’t have the right papers on them when they are approached by an immigration officer at 7 a.m. might be on a plane to Mexico by the evening. Deporting immigrants in this manner is not only an insult to due process; it will often put the nation in violation of its international obligations. Expedited removal isn’t meant to be used against individuals who credibly fear persecution in their home countries. But statements by Trump’s surrogates and actions by his previous administration suggest that this requirement will be honored in name only. According to Customs and Border Protection’s own guidelines, immigration officers are supposed to ask those in expedited-removal proceedings about their fear of return. The administration could easily roll back this guidance such that immigrants who do not know to state their fear of return will be summarily deported. The bar for passing a credible-fear interview, which is intended to serve merely as a screening tool to determine whether an individual can make their case in court, has historically been very low. Even with this low bar, those with meritorious asylum claims have been erroneously deported. But the prior Trump administration unlawfully raised the bar for credible-fear interviews and will likely attempt to do so again, allowing ICE officers to deport many more individuals with meritorious claims for asylum with little to no oversight or review and with no recourse for the noncitizen. Officers will move particularly quickly against those without a lawyer. The upshot is that even though most immigrants residing in the U.S. without permanent legal status are ineligible for expedited removal, hundreds of thousands—including individuals who are targeted because of their political beliefs, authorized immigrants, and possibly even citizens who don’t fit the Trump administration’s image of a “real” American—could be rounded up and deported without the opportunity to appear before an immigration judge. The administration will bank on individuals with strong cases being unable to litigate them once they’re deported. Families will be torn apart. Prices will spike. And an untold number of individuals who are legally entitled to asylum will be returned to countries where they’ll face death or serious harm. Although groups like the ACLU will challenge the expanded use of expedited removal, don’t look to the courts for a quick remedy. IIRIRA strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear challenges to many immigration policies. And even if the courts reach the merits of those cases, the administration has the power of unilateral action: As it did during Trump’s first term, it can change the rules, restart deportations in a slightly different way, and force lawyers and courts to play catch-up as planes full of deportees depart the U.S. Perhaps the most relevant precedent for the situation the nation faces is the battle over the Muslim ban Trump put in place at the beginning of his first administration; that policy threw the border into chaos and was repeatedly halted before the Supreme Court allowed a cleaned-up, watered-down version to take effect. That experience teaches that the key to resisting mass deportation will be to slow the program’s momentum to allow Congress, the courts, civil society, and the business community to push back. There’s no silver bullet. But states can make clear that they’ll resist the administration’s unconstitutional plans, as Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has done; strip immunity from sheriffs and others who participate in indiscriminate roundups; impose civil and criminal liability on those who participate in illegal deportations; and allocate funding for immigrant representation, following the lead of states such as New Jersey and New York. Nonprofit organizations and lawyers can provide community education on the limits of expedited removal, the right to a hearing, and the ways individuals can claim asylum or show they’re not subject to expedited removal. And business leaders can take a stand to protect the economy.

James Clyburn (D-SC) stated that he has told members of President Joe Biden’s staff that the President ought to preemptively pardon President-Elect Donald Trump and Liz Cheney, Jack Smith, and Dr. Anthony Fauci because “we are trying to run a government on behalf of all the people of this country, and if we spend all of our time going forward pursuing Trump or Trump pursuing” those people, it would be detrimental and the air needs to be cleared. Host Mike Viqueira asked, “Have you specifically urged President Biden to pardon — preemptively — Donald Trump?” Clyburn responded, “I have not urged the President directly. But I did have that discussion with the members of his staff that I thought he ought to do that. I think we need to clear the air in this country…we are trying to run a government on behalf of all the people of this country, and if we spend all of our time going forward pursuing Trump or Trump pursuing Liz Cheney, Jack Smith, Dr. Fauci, that is what we need to get off the table.

81,FEC Filings: Elon Musk Spent Over $250M Helping Trump,"Billionaire Elon Musk spent more than a quarter-billion dollars of his wealth in the final months of the presidential election to help President-elect Donald Trump return to the White House, according to new filings with the Federal Election Commission. Much of the money went into groups allied with Trump, including $20 million toward a super PAC named after late liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg that sought to soften Trump's positions against abortion, reports The New York Times. The bulk of Musk's donations, though, went to America PAC, which he created with the backing of several prominent tech businessmen. In the final weeks of the presidential race, Musk issued three checks, for $25 million each, toward the PAC. He also spent $40.5 million on checks to swing state voters who signed the group's conservative-leaning petition. Overall, Musk gave his America PAC $239 million in cash and in-kind contributions during the 2024 presidential race. Even after the election was over, Musk was still donating toward his super PAC, giving it $4 million on Nov. 12, one week after the election was over. He says he will keep the super PAC active while using it to support Trump's agenda and target progressive prosecutors. Musk, along with Ohio billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have been tagged to head Trump's planned Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The two met with GOP lawmakers Thursday on Capitol Hill to discuss some of their plans for cutting government spending and streamlining the national bureaucracy. Musk's total spending on the election is not yet known, reports The Times. His donations include $12 million to the Senate Leadership Fund and the Sentinel Action Fund, two groups working to elect Republican senators. A trust belonging to Musk, meanwhile, showed he was the sole funder of the RBG PAC, which hadn't disclosed its donors before a filing late Thursday. The group pulled in $20.5 million from a single donation from the Elon Musk Revocable Trust in Austin, Texas, reports NBC News, quoting the FEC's reports. The filings further show that Musk donated $3 million to the MAHA Alliance, the super PAC affiliated with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s ""Make America Healthy Again"" agenda in late October.

160,Energy CEO Who Drank Fracking Fluid Is Now Trump’s Oil Evangelist,"Standing shoulder to shoulder with his employees, Chris Wright, chief executive officer of oilfield services company Liberty Energy Inc., held up his glass in a toast. “To your health and the longer lives and healthier lives of billions of people around the world from oil and gas,” Wright said. Then he gulped down a shot of fracking fluid. By quaffing the chemical cocktail of water, bleach, soap and other substances in a 2019 Facebook video, Wright, Donald Trump’s nominee for energy secretary, sought to refute fracking opponents who argued it would poison aquifers. Five years later, the stunt suggests how he might carry out US energy policy: with a flair for showmanship and an appetite for confrontation. In a slew of TV interviews and speeches, Wright has proclaimed the moral virtues of fossil fuels and championed them as a way to lift people out of poverty. A few years ago, he picked a public fight with The North Face Inc. after the outwear maker declined to make a co-branded jacket with a Liberty competitor because of its oil-industry links. (Wright commissioned billboards that said: “That North Face puffer looks great on you. And it was made from fossil fuels.”) He has called greenhouse-gas reduction goals “perverse,” questioned the environmental benefits of electric vehicles and attacked subsidies for wind and solar projects. His outspokenness is poised to set him apart from Trump’s previous energy secretaries, the comparatively buttoned-up Rick Perry and Dan Brouillette. But Wright, an industry insider who would be taking on his first political role, can be nuanced. A self-professed “nerdy guy,” he frequently gives lectures about the global energy system, using data-heavy charts to illustrate his points. Rather than deny climate change outright, he characterizes it as a “modest phenomenon.” “Wright is literally an evangelist for better human living through the production of more hydrocarbons,” said Jim Lucier, managing director at Capital Alpha Partners, a research group in Washington. His appointment is indicative of Trump’s hard pivot toward fossil fuels after years of Biden administration policies that benefited renewables. There’s actually little Wright can do to boost drilling from a perch atop the Energy Department, which doesn’t have oversight of federal oil and natural gas leases. But he could revamp the agency’s clean-energy loan program to fund projects favored by Republicans, a potential boon for gas and nuclear plants. He could also speed the approval of gas exports, cementing America’s status as a major supplier of the fuel to Europe and Asia. He would also almost certainly be instrumental in fulfilling Trump’s promises to help the coal industry, build more power plants, expand electrical grids and cut the overall price of energy by half. And he'll serve on Trump's newly created National Energy Council along side North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Trump's nominee for Interior Secretary. Wright didn’t respond to a request for comment. If confirmed by the Senate, Wright would lead a department with about 16,000 employees, more than double the size of his own company's 5,500-person workforce. In addition to promoting advancements in energy technology, the agency is responsible for ensuring the safety of the US arsenal of nuclear weapons. The Energy Department’s $400 billion green bank could prove to be a tantalizing tool for Wright. Though it was once marked for death under the first Trump administration, Wright could use the loan program to finance projects such as hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and small modular reactors. Wright, who has spoken about the benefits of nuclear power, serves on the board of Oklo Inc., an SMR developer chaired by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and his company is an investor in geothermal energy and sodium-ion battery technology. The head of Occidental Petroleum Corp., an oil producer that’s building the world’s largest plant to pull carbon dioxide directly from the air, said she’s enthusiastic about Wright’s nomination and deemed Trump’s reelection a boon for carbon capture and the oil and gas industry. Occidental is set to receive as much as $650 millionBloomberg Terminal from the Energy Department for carbon capture. “I don’t think that President Trump could have picked anyone better,” Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub said in an interview at a shale conference last month. “We need someone who understands the importance of our energy independence, and oil and gas development here in the US.” But emerging clean technologies championed by the Biden administration — including those that rival oil and gas, like certain types of batteries — could lose a critical funding source. “We think the Energy Department has an extremely important role to play both in terms of its innovation programs, the research and development and the deployment we’ve seen grow under Biden,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “We’d really like to see an energy secretary lean into this and build on it — not take it in the opposite direction.” Like Trump’s first energy secretary, Perry, Wright is a vocal proponent of liquefied natural gas terminals. US LNG developers need permits from the Energy Department to export gas. While the Biden administration put new authorizations on hold to review the projects’ climate impact, Trump’s transition team is already crafting an executive order to lift the moratorium. Wright was scheduled to meet Wednesday with with Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican who is set to chair the powerful energy committee, and Senator John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican, who is also on the committee, according to a transition team official. Wright, 59, was born in New Jersey and raised in Colorado, the youngest of four children born within four years to a father who worked in the investment industry and a mother who managed the home. After earning an engineering degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he founded a company called Pinnacle Technologies in 1992. Pinnacle developed a mapping software that was “instrumental in the development” of oil- and gas-rich shale formations previously thought to be inaccessible, said Paul Vitek, who was chief financial officer at Liberty Resources LLC, a company Wright started to help take advantage of the technology he created. Wright took a subsequent company, now known as Liberty Energy, public in 2018 as the shale boom propelled US oil output to record highs. Wright acknowledges the Earth is warming, but he believes the effects can be managed through human ingenuity — a position that puts him at odds with the scientific consensus that the world faces catastrophic impacts if emissions aren’t slashed. He credits fossil fuels with providing affordable energy that's helped alleviate poverty around the globe. Earlier this year, Wright founded a nonprofit to assist people in developing nations cook with gas stoves instead of dung or wood. He says the costs of curbing fossil-fuel use would be enormous. “If instead of raising CO2 concentration by 50% we cut it by 50%, that would be a crisis,” he said, adding that plants need carbon dioxide to grow. He also says Earth is getting “meaningfully greener,” citing research into leaf size. And Wright sees no long-term increase in damage from natural disasters, though government data suggests otherwise. One thing Wright probably can’t do is deliver on Trump’s vow to “frack, frack, frack.” Oil prices, set by the global market, have slid in recent months on concern that demand will fall short of supply. Concern about a glut, along with pressure to restrain spending and return cash to shareholders, is likely to cause US producers to slow drilling activity. Wright has slammed subsidies for wind and solar power, saying at the Enercom Denver conference earlier this year that “they’ve made electricity more expensive and the grid less reliable.” But killing the tax breaks outright would require an act of Congress. He’s argued that the energy-intensive process to manufacture electric vehicles means “you have to drive a Tesla 80,000 miles to get its greenhouse gas emissions down to the level of an internal combustion engine.” Still, Wright could help fulfill Trump’s promise to refill the nation’s emergency cache of oil following the Biden administration’s drawdown in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While adding barrels to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve wouldn’t change producers’ long-term plans, it could provide a modest lift for oil prices in the short term. Jerry Simmons, president of the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, said to have someone like Wright “in a cabinet position is just huge.” The industry group was founded by oil billionaire and Trump adviser Harold Hamm, who advocated for Wright to be tapped for Energy Secretary. Dan Eberhart, chief executive officer of oilfield services company Canary LLC, said Wright has a deep understanding of the industry. ""We can't address climate change or any of the challenges facing us from a place of weakness,” Eberhart said. “Under Wright, the Energy Department will champion abundant and affordable energy.""",Bloomberg,Lean Left,1470,"Lean Right

59,"Memphis police use excessive force and discriminate against Black people, Justice Department finds","MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — The Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people, according to the findings of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation launched after the beating death of Tyre Nichols after a traffic stop in 2023. A report released Wednesday marked the conclusion of the investigation that began six months after Nichols was kicked, punched and hit with a police baton as five officers tried to arrest him after he fled a traffic stop. The report says that “Memphis police officers regularly violate the rights of the people they are sworn to serve.” “The people of Memphis deserve a police department and city that protects their civil and constitutional rights, garners trust and keeps them safe,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said in an emailed statement. The city said in a letter released earlier Wednesday that it would not agree to negotiate federal oversight of its police department until it could review and challenge results of the investigation. City officials had no immediate comment on the report but said they plan to hold a news conference Thursday after Justice Department officials hold their own news conference in Memphis on Thursday morning to address the findings. Police video showed officers pepper spraying Nichols and hitting him with a Taser before he ran away from a traffic stop. Five officers chased down Nichols and kicked, punched and hit him with a police baton just steps from his home as he called out for his mother. The video showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries. Nichols died on Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating. The five officers — Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin, Desmond Mills Jr. and Justin Smith — were fired, charged in state court with murder, and indicted by a federal grand jury on civil rights and witness tampering charges. Nichols was Black, as are the former officers. His death led to national protests, raised the volume on calls for police reforms in the U.S., and directed intense scrutiny towards the police department in Memphis, a majority Black city. The Memphis Police Department is more than 50 percent Black, and police chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis is also Black. The report specifically mentions the Nichols case, and it addresses the police department’s practice of using traffic stops to address violent crime. The police department has encouraged officers in specialized units, task forces, and on patrol to prioritize street enforcement, and officers and community members have described this approach as “saturation,” or flooding neighborhoods with traffic stops, the report said. “This strategy involves frequent contact with the public and gives wide discretion to officers, which requires close supervision and clear rules to direct officers’ activity,” the report said. “But MPD does not ensure that officers conduct themselves in a lawful manner.” The report said prosecutors and judges told federal investigators that officers do not understand the constitutional limits on their authority. Officers stop and detain people without adequate justification, and they conduct invasive searches of people and cars, the report said. “Black people in Memphis disproportionately experience these violations,” the report said. “MPD has never assessed its practices for evidence of discrimination. We found that officers treat Black people more harshly than white people who engage in similar conduct.” The investigation found that Memphis officers resort to force likely to cause pain or injury “almost immediately in response to low-level, nonviolent offenses, even when people are not aggressive.” The report says officers pepper sprayed, kicked and fired a Taser at an unarmed man with a mental illness who tried to take a $2 soda from a gas station. By the end of an encounter outside the gas station, at least nine police cars and 12 officers had responded to the incident, for which the man served two days in jail for theft and disorderly conduct. In a letter to the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division released earlier Wednesday, Memphis City Attorney Tannera George Gibson said the city had received a request from the DOJ to enter into an agreement that would require it to “negotiate a consent decree aimed at institutional police and emergency services.” A consent decree is an agreement requiring reforms that are overseen by an independent monitor and are approved by a federal judge. The federal oversight can continue for years, and violations could result in fines paid by the city. It remains to be seen what will happen to attempts to reach such agreements between cities and the Justice Department once President-elect Donald Trump returns to office and installs new department leadership. The Justice Department under the first Trump administration curtailed the use of consent decrees, and the Republican president-elect is expected to again radically reshape the department’s priorities around civil rights. “Until the City has had the opportunity to review, analyze, and challenge the specific allegations that support your forthcoming findings report, the City cannot — and will not — agree to work toward or enter into a consent decree that will likely be in place for years to come and will cost the residents of Memphis hundreds of millions of dollars,” the letter said. The officers in the Nichols case were part of a crime suppression team called the Scorpion Unit, which was disbanded after Nichols’ death. The team targeted drugs, illegal guns and violent offenders, with the goal of amassing arrest numbers, while sometimes using force against unarmed people. Memphis police never adopted policies and procedures to direct the unit, despite alarms that it was minimally supervised, according to the Justice Department report. Some prosecutors told department investigators that there were some “outrageous” inconsistences between body camera footage and arrest reports, and if the cases went to trial, they would be “laughed out of court.” The report found that the unit’s misconduct led to dozens of criminal cases being dismissed. In court proceedings dealing with Nichols’ death, Martin and Mills pleaded guilty to the federal charges under deals with prosecutors. The other three officers were convicted in early October of witness tampering related to the cover-up of the beating. Bean and Smith were acquitted of civil rights charges of using excessive force and being indifferent to Nichols’ serious injuries. Haley was acquitted of violating Nichols’ civil rights causing death, but he was convicted of two lesser charges of violating his civil rights causing bodily injury. The five men face sentencing by a federal judge in the coming months. Martin and Mills also are expected to change their not guilty pleas in state court, according to lawyers involved in the case. Bean, Haley and Smith have also pleaded not guilty to state charges of second-degree murder. A trial in the state case has been set for April 28. Justice Department investigators have targeted other cities with similar probes in recent years, including Minneapolis after the killing of George Floyd, and Louisville, Kentucky, following an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor. In its letter, the city of Memphis said the DOJ’s investigation “only took 17 months to complete, compared to an average of 2-3 years in almost every other instance, implying a rush to judgment.” Mattise reported from Nashville, Tennessee, and Durkin Richer reported from Washington.",APNEWS,Left,1214,"Left

319,South Korean president reverses martial law declaration after immediate opposition from parliament,"South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol backed down early Wednesday after tossing his country into turmoil by suddenly declaring martial law and mobilizing the army. Yoon did so in the face of nationwide defiance that erupted some 155 minutes after he announced in a late-night TV address on Tuesday that he was taking over. Members of South Korea’s parliament raced to the National Assembly building and, with 190 of its 300 members present, they quickly passed a resolution demanding that Yoon lift his order while protesters opposed to martial law gathered outside the building. “I have accepted the decision made by the National Assembly to dissolve and lift the martial law,” Yoon said in an address to the nation via television broadcast nationwide. It was an abrupt end to a standoff that began when parliament publicly defied Yoon and passed a resolution that martial law was officially nullified. After the vote, National Assembly Chairman Woo Won-sik demanded that the special forces leave the building and grounds of parliament. Shortly afterward, the soldiers began filing out through one of the gates. “I regret what happened today,” said Han Dong Hoon, leader of the ruling People Power Party to which Yoon belongs. “Exercise of military police and other government authority is illegal now that the resolution for the nullification of the martial law has passed.” But the country’s Defense Ministry said that martial law would remain in place until Yoon lifted the order. For several hours, there was no immediate response from Yoon, whose conservative government took office in 2022 and who, as justification for declaring martial law, accused opposition parties of sympathizing with North Korea and controlling parliament. “I am declaring a state of emergency in order to protect the constitutional order based on freedom and eradicate shameful pro-North Korea anti-state groups, that are stealing freedom and happiness of our people,” Yoon said on the country’s YTN news channel. He added that this would protect the country “from the threats of North Korea’s communist forces.” “While the imposition of martial law may cause significant inconvenience to the law-abiding citizens who uphold the constitutional values of the Republic of Korea, I will strive to minimize these disruptions,” he added. Yoon’s address was quickly followed by a proclamation from Martial Law Commander, Gen. Park Ahn-soo. It said that “all political activities” would be banned, and that “all media and publications will be subject to the control of the Martial Law Command.” “Strikes, work slowdowns, and gatherings that incite social disorder are forbidden,” it added. It also ordered “all medical professionals” to return to work within 48 hours. “Violators of this proclamation will be subject to arrest, detention, and search and seizure without a warrant under Article 9 of the Martial Law Act,” it said. At the U.S. State Department, Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel said it had received no advance warning that Yoon was about to declare martial law. Earlier, the White House National Security Council confirmed that the Biden administration had been in contact with the South Korean government and that it was “monitoring the situation closely.” “The situation is fluid,” Philip Goldberg , the U.S. ambassador to South Korea posted on X before Yoon announced the end of martial law. South Korean Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, who had to climb over a fence to get into the National Assembly building, called Yoon’s martial law declaration “illegal and unconstitutional.” It was the first time since 1980 that martial law has been declared in South Korea. There were no reports of tanks or soldiers on the streets in the capital, Seoul, or elsewhere in South Korea, which is a key U.S. ally in the region and home to around 28,500 American troops. More from NBC News: “Right now there has been essentially no impact on U.S. forces,” Pentagon Press Secretary Major General Pat Ryder said before Yoon backed down. But South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported that dozens of people had gathered in front of the National Assembly in the early hours of the morning local time, leading to scuffles with police. The Korean won fell sharply against the U.S. dollar after Yoon declared martial law. Yoon has struggled to push through his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament, and his approval rating has nosedived in recent months due to various controversies. His People Power Party has clashed with the liberal opposition Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, over next year’s budget. The Democratic Party has also pushed to impeach some of the country’s top officials. Still, experts on South Korean politics said Yoon’s dramatic power grab was unexpected. “It really is quite an extraordinary situation and a genuine surprise,” said Edward Howell, the Korean Foundation Fellow at Chatham House, a British think tank that focuses on international affairs. “It’s almost as if President Yoon went straight for the most extreme option first.” Stella Kim reported from Seoul, and Freddie Clayton from London.",CNBC,Center,821,"Lean Right

145,Agency Allows Tens Of Thousands Of Bureaucrats To Work Remotely For Years As Trump Return Looms,"A Biden administration appointee agreed to a new contract with a government employee union that will allow tens of thousands of bureaucrats to work remotely for years ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House, according to Bloomberg News. Recently-departed Social Security Administration (SSA) Commissioner Martin O’Malley signed off on a new deal last week with the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) — which represents about 42,000 SSA employees — that will extend remote work availability into 2029, according to Bloomberg News. The incoming Trump administration and the newly-minted Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), are poised to target work-from-home policies for government employees as part of a broader push to rein in the federal government and eliminate bureaucratic bloat. The agreement will effectively allow SSA employees to maintain their current levels of remote work through Trump’s term, according to Bloomberg News, which learned of the deal before its public announcement. Currently, SSA employees are required to be in the office between two and five days each week depending on what their specific job is. (RELATED: Most EPA Employees Really Don’t Want To Show Back Up To The Office, Survey Finds) Social Security Commissioner Martin O’Malley testifies before the Senate Committee on the Budget at the U.S. Capitol on September 11, 2024 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images) “This deal will secure not just telework for SSA employees, but will secure staffing levels through prevention of higher attrition, which in turn will secure the ability of the Agency to serve the public,” AFGE chapter president Rich Couture wrote in a message to his members reviewed by Bloomberg News. Labor unions have lobbied the lame duck Biden administration to reach agreements with federal employees before Trump officially takes office in January 2025, according to Bloomberg News. “Under President Trump’s leadership, the Government Efficiency effort led by Vivek and Elon will target waste and fraud throughout our massive federal bureaucracy,” Trump transition team spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement shared with the Daily Caller News Foundation. “They will work together slashing excess regulations, cutting wasteful expenditures, and restructuring Federal Agencies.” Billionaire businessmen Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, Trump’s two picks to run DOGE, recently wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that a mandatory return-to-office policy across the federal government could induce some federal employees to voluntarily find other work in what would be a welcome development. It is unclear what the Trump administration may try to do about the new contract upon taking office next month, but moving to unilaterally nix it could initiate a lengthy legal battle, according to Bloomberg News. Elsewhere in the federal government, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the AFGE locked in a new contract in May, which contains protections meant to allow employees to report scientific misconduct or discuss their work with the press without retribution, according to Bloomberg News. Employees at the Justice Department are also organizing with the National Treasury Employees Union in an effort to be recognized before President Joe Biden leaves the White House. The SSA and AFGE did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

211,Longtime Rep. Nadler drops bid to remain top Democrat on Judiciary Committee after challenge,"WASHINGTON — Longtime Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said Wednesday he was dropping his bid to remain the top Democrat on the powerful Judiciary Committee for the next two years and endorsed Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who announced just two days ago that he would challenge Nadler for the coveted job. In a letter to Democratic colleagues, Nadler, 77, threw his support behind Raskin, 61, for the role, which will be critical in providing congressional oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department in the incoming Trump administration. Nadler's decision to bow out clears the path for Raskin, who faces no other challengers. “As our country faces the return of Donald Trump, and the renewed threats to our democracy and our way of life that he represents, I am very confident that Jamie would ably lead the Judiciary Committee as we confront this growing danger,” Nadler wrote in the letter. “Therefore, I have decided not to run for Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee in the 119th Congress.” Nadler has held the top Democratic job on the Judiciary panel since 2019 and has served in Congress since 1992.

The New York Times was first to report Nadler had dropped out of the race. Raskin, a former constitutional law professor, was elected to Congress in 2016 and has been the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee for the past two years. His move to Judiciary opens up the race to be the top Democrat on Oversight; Gerry Connolly, of Virginia, has already announced a bid for that job, while other Oversight members, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, are testing the waters. Connolly is 74, and Ocasio-Cortez is 35. ""To me, it's not generational. It's about experience and record and capability, that's how I got to present it,"" Connolly told reporters, adding that he led an Oversight subcommittee. ""And she's a new talent and has a lot of promise, but I'm the only one in the race ... who, in fact, has a subcommittee. I've invested in the committee. I think that's really important."" Ocasio-Cortez, who has been talking to fellow lawmakers about a potential bid, said Wednesday she didn't have anything to announce: ""I have been receiving a lot of input from my colleagues, and we'll be making a decision."" She added that she has ""tremendous respect and admiration for Gerry Connolly. ... I love Gerry."" Raskin has been a rising star in the party. Then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tapped Raskin as Democrats’ lead prosecutor in the Trump impeachment trial after the Jan. 6 attack, then appointed him as a member of the special committee tasked with investigating the Capitol assault. In 2022, he wrote a book, ""Unthinkable: Trauma, Truth, and the Trials of American Democracy,"" in which he reflected on his 25-year-old son's death by suicide on Dec. 31, 2020, and the Capitol riot six days later. “In the 119th Congress, the Judiciary Committee will be the headquarters of Congressional opposition to authoritarianism and MAGA’s campaign to dismantle our Constitutional system and the rule of law as we know it,” Raskin, a two-time cancer survivor, wrote to colleagues this week announcing his bid. “I hope to be at the center of this fight and — as someone who has battled cancer and chemotherapy — I can tell you that I will never, never surrender,” he said.",NBC,Lean Left,616,"Lean Left

270,US weekly jobless claims edge up; falling imports compress trade deficit,"WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week, pointing to steadily easing labor market conditions heading into the final stretch of 2024. Sluggish hiring, however, means some people who lose their jobs are collecting unemployment checks for longer periods relative to early this year, potentially keeping the jobless rate above 4.0%. Economists said this should allow the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again this month despite stalled progress in lowering inflation to the U.S. central bank's 2% target. ""Claims remain low by long-run standards, but still high enough to perpetuate the rising trend in the unemployment rate, given very modest hiring,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 224,000 for the week ended Nov. 30, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 215,000 claims for the latest week. The data included the Thanksgiving holiday, which could have injected some noise into the report. Claims are entering a period of volatility, which could make it difficult to get a clear picture of the labor market. Unadjusted claims dropped 34,967 to 210,166 last week amid a plunge of 9,777 in filings in California and a tumble of 6,383 in Texas. There were also sizeable declines in Florida and North Carolina as the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton faded. Other states reporting notable decreases included Georgia, New York, Wisconsin and Illinois. Claims remain at levels consistent with continued job growth, and have signaled a sharp rebound in nonfarm payrolls in November after the labor market was severely distorted by Helene and Milton as well as strikes by factory workers at Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab and another aerospace company. Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 200,000 jobs in November after rising by 12,000 in October, the lowest number since December 2020, a Reuters survey showed. The unemployment rate is forecast to rise to 4.2% from 4.1% in October. The historically low layoffs account for most of the labor market's strength. Hefty interest rate hikes from the Fed in 2022 and 2023 to tame inflation have left companies with little appetite to hire more workers. The Fed's ""Beige Book"" report on Wednesday described employment as ""flat or up only slightly"" across the central bank's districts in November. It also noted ""hiring activity was subdued as worker turnover remained low and few firms reported increasing their headcount,"" adding that ""the level of layoffs was also reportedly low."" The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, fell 25,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.871 million during the week ending Nov. 23, the claims report showed. Unadjusted so-called continuing claims increased by 5,927 in Washington state, likely because of the lingering effects of the Boeing strike. They also rose considerably in Minnesota, but fell sharply in California, Florida and Georgia. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Yields on shorter-dated U.S. Treasury notes rose. ""Perhaps workers laid off at related suppliers aren't being rehired in anticipation of the coming layoffs at Boeing,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. The Fed launched its easing cycle in September, having hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023. It is widely expected to deliver another rate cut later this month. The interest rate outlook for 2025 is uncertain amid threats of tariffs and tax-cut promises from President-elect Donald Trump. Economists have said these actions would raise prices and increase government borrowing. A separate report from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis showed the trade deficit contracted 11.9% to $73.8 billion in October as imports declined by the most since late 2022, potentially positioning trade to contribute to economic growth this quarter. Economists had forecast the trade deficit would ease to $75.0 billion. Imports dropped 4.0%, the biggest decrease since November 2022, to $339.6 billion. Goods imports tumbled 5.5% to $269.3 billion. Businesses concerned about Trump's threats to raise tariffs could try to front-load imports, which would reverse October's drop. Trump has said he would impose a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China on his first day in office. Worries about a potential dock workers strike in January could also see businesses scrambling to get more imports in. Imports of capital goods decreased $7.5 billion in October, weighed down by declines in imports of computers and semiconductors. Imports of industrial supplies and materials, which include petroleum, fell $3.3 billion. Petroleum imports at $17.2 billion were the lowest since June 2021. There were also decreases in imports of consumer goods, mostly pharmaceutical preparations. Imports of automotive vehicles, parts and engines also fell. Imports of services rose $1.4 billion to a record high $70.2 billion, boosted by travel, charges for the use of intellectual property, transport, insurance and other business services. Exports fell 1.6% to $265.7 billion. Goods exports dropped 3.0% to $170.7 billion, led by a $3.9 billion decrease in capital goods exports. Shipments of automotive vehicles, parts and engines also fell, as did those of industrial supplies and materials, and consumer goods. Exports of services increased $1.0 billion to an all-time high of $95.1 billion. They were lifted by travel, other business services, maintenance and repair, transport and charges for the use of intellectual property. Exports of telecommunications, computer and information services also rose. The goods trade deficit narrowed 9.5% to $98.7 billion. It decreased 7.3% to $92.4 billion when adjusted for inflation, prompting the Atlanta Fed to raise its GDP estimate for the fourth quarter to a 3.3% annualized rate from a 3.3% pace. The economy grew at a 2.8% annualized rate in the July-September quarter. Trade has been a drag on economic growth for three straight quarters.

370,California Fast Food Restaurants Shed Thousands of Jobs after $20 Minimum Wage Hike,"California’s fast food industry shed more than 6,000 jobs after Democratic lawmakers passed a bill mandating a $20 minimum wage for most fast food and counter service restaurants in the state, according to a new analysis of labor data. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that between September 2023, when California governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 1228, and June 2024, Golden State fast food employment dropped from 570,909 jobs to 564,743. That’s a loss of 6,166 jobs, or 1.1 percent, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Employment Policies Institute. During that same period a year earlier, California fast food restaurants added 17,528 jobs, a 3.1 percent increase over those ten months in 2022 and 2023, the data show. “Newsom took a sledgehammer to the state’s restaurants when he signed the $20 fast food minimum wage law,” Rebekah Paxton, EPI’s research director, said in a press release. “Jobs have been smashed by thousands and the industry is struggling to stay afloat.” The fast food minimum wage hike — a 25 percent jump over the $16 minimum wage in place for virtually every other sector of the California economy — was the result of a years-long campaign by Big Labor leaders and their Democratic allies to target an industry they’ve long struggled to organize. In 2022, California Democrats passed the Fast Food Accountability and Standards Recovery Act, or FAST Act, which would have created an unelected fast food council that could have hiked the industry’s minimum wage to $22 an hour. The restaurant industry fought back, gathering enough signatures for a ballot initiative to challenge the act. But Democrats had a fallback plan of their own; last year, for the first time in two decades, they funded what is known as the Industrial Welfare Commission, which has the authority to regulate wages, hours, and working conditions for industries across the state. AB 1228 was a compromise between the fast food industry and lawmakers. In exchange for eliminating the most extreme aspects of the FAST Act, the fast food industry agreed to drop its ballot initiative and raise starting pay to $20 an hour starting April 1, 2024. The $20 minimum wage is in place for fast food restaurants with at least 60 locations nationwide. Ahead of the wage hike, some pizza chains began laying off delivery drivers and farming out delivery operations to third-party apps. Leaders of some chains acknowledged they would raise prices to cover the additional labor costs. Restaurants increasingly turned to technology and robots to increase efficiency and reduce labor costs. Fast food restaurant owners who spoke to National Review last spring said that because of the wage hike, “everything is on the table” in terms of cost cutting. In June, Rubio’s Coastal Grill, a Mexican chain, shuttered 48 of its California restaurants, citing the “rising cost of doing business” in the state. During the ten months when California fast food restaurants slashed 6,000 jobs, employment in fast food restaurants rose 1.6 percent nationwide, according to EPI. And while overall private employment fell slightly in California during that ten-month period, dropping 0.3 percent, the decline was steeper in the fast food industry. In the wake of the fast food wage hike in April, California voters last month rejected Proposition 32, a ballot measure that would have increased the state’s minimum wage from $16 to $18. It was the first time in the state’s history that Californians voted down a ballot measure to increase the statewide minimum wage.

199,"Gunman who killed Brian Thompson, UnitedHealthcare CEO, is on the loose. What we know about the suspect.","New York — A manhunt is underway in New York for the gunman who shot and killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson Wednesday morning in what authorities said appeared to have been a targeted attack. Thompson, 50, was shot multiple times around 6:45 a.m. outside the Hilton Midtown hotel on Sixth Avenue near West 54th Street in New York City, officials said at a press conference Wednesday. Thompson was not a guest at the Hilton but was staying at another hotel nearby and walking to the Hilton for a corporate event when he was attacked. The shooting happened ahead of an investors conference that UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, was scheduled to host on Wednesday at the Hilton, according to a spokesperson for the subsidiary. The suspect has not been identified. He is a light-skinned man and was wearing a grey colored backpack, which NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny described as ""very distinctive."" Kenny said the gunman was also wearing a light brown or cream-colored jacket, black face mask and black-and-white sneakers. The suspect appeared to be lying in wait for Thompson for several minutes, newly sworn-in Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said during Wednesday's news conference. A senior NYPD official told CBS News that the suspect's arrival before Thompson indicates he knew where the CEO was staying and when he would arrive at the conference. ""Based on the evidence we have so far it does appear that the victim was specifically targeted, but we don't know why,"" Kenny said. Police are using surveillance footage to determine how the suspect spent the hours before the shooting. At 5 a.m. Wednesday, about two hours before the attack, surveillance cameras captured the suspect outside near the Frederick Douglass Housing Project on Manhattan's Upper West Side, according to NYPD officials. Police executed a search warrant at a building in the area on Wednesday night. Police said they believe the suspect may have stayed there the night before the attack. Police also released surveillance images showing the suspect at a Starbucks two blocks from the shooting at 6:17 a.m., less than half an hour before the shooting. Police told CBS News they found unspecified ""forensic evidence"" at the Starbucks and that items recovered there are being tested for possible DNA and fingerprints by the NYPD's Crime Scene Unit. The suspect paid with cash, police said. The suspect then waited for Thompson, police said. The CEO was staying at another hotel across the street from the Hilton, Kenny said Wednesday. Thompson left his hotel shortly after 6:40 a.m. and headed to the Hilton. Kenny said police are speaking to Thompson's coworkers to understand why he was headed to the hotel so early, but said the CEO was in charge of the conference and may have been going over to help set up. The suspect approached Thompson from behind at 6:44 a.m., then shot him at least once in the back and once in the right calf. A security camera captured the moment of the shooting. The suspect first fled the site of the shooting on foot, then got on a bike and headed north into Central Park. The suspect was seen in the park on surveillance footage. Tisch initially said the suspect used an electronic Citi Bike to get away, but Lyft said the NYPD later told the company, which owns and operates Citi Bike, that was not the case. A joint law enforcement task force said they were conducting a reverse video canvass, where investigators will look at footage from all cameras from the crime scene and in the surrounding areas to try to track the suspect's escape route. The canvass showed the suspect exiting the west side of the park somewhere between 70th and 80th streets. Police are examining surveillance video of what appears to be the suspect at 6:59 a.m., about 15 minutes after the shooting, riding a bike on West 85th Street. Three live 9 mm rounds and three discharged 9 mm shell casings were recovered from the scene, Kenny said. On Thursday, law enforcement officials confirmed to CBS News that the words ""deny,"" ""defend,"" and ""depose"" were written on the the shell casings recovered at the scene of the attack. The words were written meticulously in Sharpie, according to a source briefed on the investigation. The law enforcement officials said investigators were looking at whether the words point to a motive related to insurance companies' responses to claims. Investigators believe this could be a reference to the ""three D's of insurance,"" a known reference made by opponents of the industry, two law enforcement sources told CBS News. They are also similar to the words used as the title of a book published in 2010 about the denial of insurance claims. ABC News first reported that the words were found written on the shell casings recovered at the scene of the shooting. Kenny said the suspect appeared to be proficient in the use of firearms, noting that the suspect appeared to quickly fix a jam in his weapon. The suspect also had a silencer on the weapon, the NYPD said. Police also found a cellphone along the route the suspect used to flee the scene. Police are doing a forensic analysis of the device to determine if it belongs to the suspect, Kenny said. Police told CBS News the phone has ""investigative value,"" but wouldn't elaborate and would not say who the phone belonged to. Investigators and security at UnitedHealthcare are combing through files searching for a possible motive, looking for possible previous threats, and disgruntled or recently fired workers, a law enforcement source said. The company said it is cooperating with the investigation. Police are also looking at social media and interviewing employees, family members and others who knew Thompson, Kenny said. On Thursday, the NYPD shared two images that multiple law enforcement sources say show the suspect without a mask on. The suspect is wearing a hood. The photos were taken at a hostel on Amsterdam Avenue, in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan, police said. Police have not said if that is the Upper West Side location searched on Wednesday night. They also did not say when the photos were taken.

244,What Elon Musk Has Said About Social Security,"As Elon Musk gears up for his first unofficial role in a U.S. administration under President-elect Donald Trump, his position on Social Security benefits is coming under scrutiny.As the largest entitlements program in the country, Social Security provides benefits to more than 70 million retirees, survivors and people with disabilities every month. But with a change of government on the horizon, the Social Security Administration (SSA) and its programs could be subject to changes.Under the incoming Trump administration, the Tesla and X owner has been appointed to co-head a new advisory body, the Department for Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The unofficial government department will be responsible for advising on streamlining costs and slashing regulations, and changes could be implemented by Trump through executive action.While Musk has not personally advocated reforms or cuts to Social Security, other Republican figures have - in defiance of Trump's election promise not to cut entitlements. As Social Security is the largest single mandatory spend for the U.S. government - totaling $1.4 trillion in 2023 - it could be a consideration for Musk's $2 trillion cost-saving agenda in 2025.

It's not even an investment; it's a tax,"" he wrote, calling for ""real, genuine reform.""Within the Social Security system, Americans should be able to invest in their own future, and not be shackled by the worst parts of this outdated, mismanaged system.""

68,Why the threat of bird flu makes this presidential transition problematic,"The next few years could see a disastrous confluence of events: the emergence of a lethal bird flu pandemic at a time when the nation’s public health leadership team is ill-equipped to deal with the consequences. What could possibly go wrong? To be clear, there is no certainty the world will face an H5N1 avian influenza (“bird flu”) pandemic next year, or at any future time. There are significant genetic barriers involved in the adaptation of the avian virus to high-level replication in humans. But it would be highly imprudent to ignore the possibility of a pandemic, with terrible consequences to America, and indeed the world. Other writers share these concerns. An H5N1 influenza outbreak in humans could be orders of magnitude more lethal than SARS-CoV-2, a virus that killed over 1 million people in the U.S. alone. Moreover, influenza viruses, once adapted to a new host (in this case humans), are usually highly transmissible, so the rate of spread across the nation could be quick. For decades now, infectious disease scientists have been worried about a new influenza pandemic; indeed, modeling scenarios in the decades before 2020 were typically based on influenza viruses, not a coronavirus. The H5N1 virus that’s infecting multiple bird species worldwide, and is increasingly spreading in the nation’s cattle herds, can be transmitted to humans, but only sporadically at present. As of this writing, there have been 58 cases of human infections identified by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These American cases have mostly been tracked back to contacts with chickens, other birds and, more recently, cattle on farms. The human infections have only rarely been severe — the symptoms are generally mild and of short duration. But the more the avian virus spreads, the more likely it is that key genetic changes will take place that enable the virus to replicate to high and dangerous levels in humans and be spread directly from one person to another. At that point, a pandemic would be quite likely. Influenza virus evolution is a numbers game; the more human infections occur, the more chances a virus has to mutate, and the more likely it is that dangerous mutations will emerge. We cannot know when, or even if, that would happen. But it would be highly irresponsible to pretend it couldn’t. Dealing with a pandemic threat requires advance planning and, when appropriate, decisive action. At present, we are in a transition between the Biden administration’s health care leadership team and Trump’s current picks to replace them. Transitions in times of danger are never ideal, but this one seems particularly problematic. Trump’s chosen leaders lack experience with public health administration and infectious diseases. In several cases, they have exhibited strong opposition to standard public health measures. Robert Kennedy Jr., whom Trump has picked to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has said to NIH scientists: “God bless you all. Thank you for public service. We’re going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years.” That’s hardly an encouraging sign. Kennedy, Martin Makary (the potential next head of the Food and Drug Administration) and Jay Bhattacharya (tapped to lead the National Institutes of Health) have made multiple statements opposing the standard public health measures that limited virus spread during the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020. Would these officials push for the use of effective masking, social distancing and lockdown strategies if an even more deadly respiratory virus started to spread rapidly in American cities? If they refused to do so based on their personal philosophies, the body count could soon be enormous. Vaccines are our best tool to curtail a pandemic. The Covid-19 vaccines, particularly those based on mRNA technology, eventually broke the back of that pandemic in 2021 and 2022 by reducing the rates of severe disease and death rates to more manageable levels. These vaccines are estimated to have saved millions of American lives, and trillions of dollars in health care costs. Conversely, Covid vaccine refusal fueled by misinformation, with conservative media outlets playing a key role, likely contributed to the approximately hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths in nonvaccinated people. Sadly, key Trump administration nominees have attacked vaccines in general, and mRNA vaccines in particular. Kennedy and potential new CDC head Dave Weldon have long records in the anti-vaccine movement, and Bhattacharya has been a prominent adviser to vaccine-opposing Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo. Would they, then, support the further development and rollout of ongoing avian influenza vaccine development programs, whether using the traditional egg-based or the more modern designs, including the safe and efficient mRNA technology? A failure to act in a timely manner would be a deadly mistake. The Department of Defense is responsible for protecting America against external military threats. It’s unimaginable that this department could be headed by pacifists who ban the use of bombers, tanks and warships. An avian influenza virus could kill vastly more Americans than would die in any conventional war, and yet we are on the cusp of appointing a health care leadership team that has dismissed infectious disease threats and rejected the best weapons available for humanity’s never-ending war on lethal viruses. The United States Senate must fulfill its constitutional requirement and flag public health nominees who may fail the nation in a foreseeable crisis. Because we simply cannot predict when the next one might strike.",MSNBC,Left,899,"Lean Left  
This article expresses concern about the incoming Trump administration's health leadership team, highlighting their opposition to public health measures and vaccine development. The focus on the potential dangers posed by their attitudes towards pandemics and health practices indicates a critical stance that aligns with left-leaning views, particularly those emphasizing governmental responsibility in managing public health crises. The framing of the discussion emphasizes the risks associated with a transition to leaders perceived as unqualified or hostile to public health, suggesting a clear bias favoring more conventional public health approaches."
16,Twenty Minnesota ballots went missing in key race that hinges on 14 votes,"Twenty ballots went missing in a Minnesota precinct this November, the type of error that would typically result in an internal investigation but not receive much public attention. But the implications are much greater right now, as the race for the district’s state house seat is separated by 14 votes, and that seat will determine whether Republicans win control of the chamber. The missing ballots, which were probably the result of human error, were never counted. Officials tried to track them down, only to learn that they had been sent to the shredder. As it stands, Democratic representative Brad Tabke won the race over Republican Aaron Paul in Minnesota’s district 54A, which covers an outer suburban area of Minneapolis. The Minnesota house is currently tied 67-67, meaning the parties will need to negotiate how to share power. If Tabke’s win were overturned, Republicans would gain control. Democrats now hold both chambers of the legislature and the governor’s office and have used their trifecta to pass a spate of progressive policies, the promotion of which helped land Tim Walz a spot on the presidential ticket this year. “This is a unusual situation,” said Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. Paul and Minnesota Republicans want to redo the election and filed a notice to contest in Scott county court. Republicans said the error and violations of election law were “of significant magnitude that it may determine the election outcome, resulting in the announced winner of the race being the candidate who the voters did not select”. “Scott county election officials unlawfully lost and failed to count significantly more ballots than would be needed to change the announced result of the election, meaning at the very least the actual victor is in absolute doubt and at worst the candidate who received fewer votes has been announced as the winner,” attorney R Reid LeBeau II wrote in the legal filing. LeBeau said in the filing that Tabke should not be issued a certificate of election, the election should be declared “invalid” and the seat vacant, and the House should refuse to seat Tabke. The vacancy once Tabke’s existing term ends would kick off a special election. The question of who got the most votes in the House contest is “unresolvable based on the ballots in possession of Scott county”, LeBeau wrote. Representative Lisa Demuth, the Republican minority leader in the house, said on X: “Ballots are missing. Election laws were violated. A new election is the only way to resolve the problems in district 54A.” Melissa Hortman, the Democratic speaker of the house, said in a statement: “Rep Brad Tabke won the election in district 54A by the count on election night and in the recount. We expect Rep Tabke will prevail again in the election contest.” The house itself could vote on whether to rerun the election or not to seat Tabke – state law for a contested election first involves the courts, but the house can then decide to hold a hearing and vote on how to handle the contest. The state constitution says each chamber “shall be the judge of the election returns and eligibility of its own members”. Instances of human error in elections happen with some frequency, though they typically are not of large enough consequence to sway election results – or to be of such outsized importance as they are in this instance, with legislative power in the balance. Jason Marisam, a law professor at Minnesota’s Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said the legal claim is an uphill battle for Paul. There is no evidence of intentionally removing ballots, and Paul would need to win the majority of the missing ballots to take the lead. The precinct in question voted strongly for Tabke – he won 58% of the vote in the Democratic-leaning area. A new election would be “a drastic step”, Marisam said. “And it’s not necessarily the fairest either, because you’re going to get a different pool of voters. There’s no way to ensure that the same people who showed up to vote in November are going to show up to vote in the special election. There’ll be fewer people, because it’ll be a standalone special election. “When you have no evidence of any wrongdoing from the candidate, no intentional wrongdoing from the election administrators, and statistically such a low probability that those ballots would change the outcome, it doesn’t seem to be sensible remedy here.” Jacobs, the University of Minnesota professor, said a new election would be “very dramatic, highly unusual step” to resolve the issue, and he does not expect the courts to call for it. But Republicans would be justified in seeking remedies in the courts for a legitimate election problem. “I think it’s important that the avenues for appeal and review be exhausted,” Jacobs said. “This is not the usual denialism. This is a fair, necessary scrutiny, and there needs to be accountability for what happened. Those 20 ballots should not have been destroyed. It can’t happen again.” If Republicans were to get the seat moved to their column, they would gain control of the house and be able to advance their policies and budget plans rather than share control with the Democrats. Either way, though, the state government will be divided. The race was recounted earlier in November, though the missing ballots were not publicly known. Scott county attorney Ron Hocevar’s investigation results were released on 27 November. Hocevar said the problem was likely the result of a human error and that the “unfortunate situation resulted in a level of confusion that should not have occurred”. Elections officials noticed discrepancies between the number of voters signed in and the number of ballots counted in two precincts in the city of Shakopee. In one of those precincts, the city reported 329 voters but results for 309 ballots, with 20 ballots missing. It would be rare for 20 voters in a small precinct to decide not to vote after checking in. The city had been slow to tabulate results on election night, Hocevar noted, so the county stepped in to help tabulate. City staff said that the total number of scanned ballots matched the amount of reported ballots – a claim that was “later found to be incorrect”. The missing absentee ballots were narrowed down to those cast in the final few days of early “envelope voting”, when early voters submit ballots that go in a secrecy envelope and then in an envelope with the voter’s signature on it. Absentee ballot boards look at signatures for validity and accept or reject them. On 17 October, election workers could start opening signature envelopes and then setting them to the side while placing secrecy envelopes in another pile for privacy reasons, the investigation noted, to prepare ballots for tabulation. The county has been “unable to verify” whether the missing ballots were ever removed from the secrecy envelopes. The secrecy envelopes, which officials are supposed to keep, had been thrown in the trash. The county tracked the trash and recycling to two landfills, but found the recycling bale had been sent for shredding. “Scott county has come to the conclusion that the ballots were likely disposed of while they were in their secrecy envelopes, after being removed from their signature envelopes but before being tabulated,” Hocevar wrote. The letter notes the investigation is ongoing. Hocevar told the Guardian he has “no position on how this should be resolved. The county is neutral on that and the campaigns and the court system have to now figure it out.”",TheGuardiadn,Left,1273,"Lean Left  
The article emphasizes the potential implications of the missing ballots on Democratic control in Minnesota, portraying the situation in a way that suggests urgency and concern for electoral integrity, which aligns with a left-leaning perspective.

47,Hit Men Aren’t What You Think,"A gunman dressed in dark clothing and wearing a mask over his lower face ambushed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Wednesday morning in midtown Manhattan, where Thompson’s company was hosting a conference. The New York Police Department said the shooting was a “targeted attack” and that the gunman remains at large, but few other details have been released. Surveillance video captured the moment the shooter calmly approached Thompson, pointed a pistol equipped with a silencer, fired multiple shots, and fled on an electric bike. Police are now combing through video footage to track him down, including at a nearby Starbucks the shooter visited. Many who noted the details of the shooting had an immediate question: Is this what a professional hit looks like in real life? The NYPD has said nothing of the sort, but that didn’t stop speculation from running rampant online. Dennis Kenney, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who has decades of expertise studying professional killers, has a unique perspective on that. He’s spent years dispelling myths about contract killings born of movies and Law & Order episodes. He told me he found aspects of the attack peculiar and agreed to talk to me while emphasizing that it’s too early to draw definitive conclusions about a crime for which very little information has been released. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Slate: What were your first impressions when you heard the details of the shooting Wednesday? Dennis Kenney: The first thing that’s unusual is that the shooter appeared to have a silencer. They’re not impossible to get, but they’re not readily available. The second thing is that he appeared to have inside information on the victim’s location. He knew where to wait and when to wait. The fact that he used the silencer didn’t make sense to me at first, until I saw that the shooting took place at about 6:30 in the morning. Generally, if it was a midmorning sort of thing, you’d want a gun that made a lot of noise to scare observers off. But obviously at that time, no one was around. It also suggested that the urgency of the shooting was important. CEOs of health care companies are just not that hard to find in isolated settings. So the fact that he chose to do it in midtown Manhattan was a little bit unique. Police called it a “brazen targeted attack.” You’ve studied contract killings and so-called hit men and sought to dispel myths about these kinds of crimes. What do you think of speculation that this was a hit? I think it’s pretty unlikely. My understanding is the CEO was being investigated for insider trading and some other financial violation. The fact that he ran a health care company—they tend to leave a lot of angry people in their wake. So, it seemed to be someone who knew what they were doing, but the idea of a professional hit man, those are pretty few and far between. So I would think more likely it was somebody with a particular grudge that had access to inside information to know where to be and when to be there. Do contract killings usually play out in such dramatic fashion? A professional hit man would probably prefer to do something less public with limited exposure. Doing it in the middle of midtown—there’s just too many things that can go wrong, so you probably prefer generally not to do it there. However, if it was time sensitive, then that would make a difference. There’s a range of hit men, so it could be somebody that was hired, but it’s unlikely. Is there any other reason you think it’s unlikely? This obviously was not the target’s usual routine. A professional would generally try to catch him in his regular routine in a place where the exposure of the shooter is minimized so that the risk of being caught or observed is pretty low. Manhattan, particularly in midtown, you’ve got cameras everywhere. I understand that they’ve got some fairly decent shots of the guy’s face while he was in Starbucks or something like that nearby. The exposure was fairly high, and most professionals don’t like that amount of risk. Again, unless it was time sensitive—there could be any number of reasons why it was important that it happened that day. Has technology, such as surveillance cameras, changed the way professional killers operate? That’s hard to know. Like most businesses, there’s a wide range of professionals. You’ve got some that are much lower-end and others that are much more skilled and with better equipment. So, I would guess this person, if they’re hired, they would be relatively on the low end. The fact that it appeared in the video that the guy’s gun might have jammed is also a little bit of a concern for a professional. You make sure your equipment works. What kind of crime would a very public shooting like this generally suggest? Does it fit a particular profile? The thing that struck me was the fact that he knew where he was going to be and when he was going to be there. Generally, you get that information by observing the individual. You find their schedule and their routine, and then you intercept them somewhere along the line on their routine. This was obviously not a routine setting. So he had to have some reason to believe that Thompson was going to be coming out of that door at an approximate time to be able to lay in wait. Because it’s Manhattan, standing around waiting risks the likelihood of being challenged by a cop or security guard coming by, which suggests that he had reason to know when the guy was going to be coming out. It suggests some sort of inside information. What are some common misconceptions people have of contract killers? How do professionals differ from portrayals we often see in movies and TV? I don’t watch that many of those kinds of movies. Most of the highly skilled folks that I’m aware of are assassins for government agencies or something such as that. But when you look at even those levels of individuals, there have been several attempted assassinations in D.C. of government officials by other government officials, and generally the only reason you know about them is that they were bungled. It’s a fairly difficult thing to do. Do law-enforcement agencies differentiate between a professional hit and other types of murders? For the most part, the investigation is done the same way. If this was a professional, then it’s obviously someone who had reason to want Thompson dead. Because he ran an insurance company, you would look at everything from individuals who have been turned down for insurance coverage and lost their spouse as a result of it. That would be one thing the police would look for. They’ll first look for the reason why he was killed. And once you come up with the reason, then it’s much easier to find the person responsible for it.",SLATE,Left,1182,"Center

247,Ireland’s election delivers pro-business continuity despite voter discontent,"Ireland’s election looks set to have secured victory for the incumbent center-right parties which have dominated the country’s politics for nearly a century, signaling continuity for the business community but belying broad dissatisfaction with many social issues. Fianna Fáil, led by Micheál Martin, and Fine Gael, helmed by Simon Harris, by midday Monday appeared able to form a coalition just shy of a parliamentary majority in the 174-seat Dáil, and are widely expected to seek backing from one or two smaller opposition parties to form a government. A key question will be who takes on the role of taoiseach, the Irish leader, given that Harris currently holds the role but Fianna Fáil will become the bigger party. One possibility is a repeat of the rotating power-share arrangement the two parties previously brokered in 2020, when they first entered a coalition. Friday’s vote delivered some shock losses for high-profile names, along with disappointment for previous coalition member the Green party — which retained just one of 12 seats — and for challenger Sinn Féin, which is expected to equal Fine Gael’s number of TDs (parliamentarians), but does not appear able to begin its own coalition talks. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have ruled out a partnership with the left-leaning party. The result “breaks with the trend seen internationally this year for weaker incumbent election results,” analysts at investment firm Davy said in a note. “The only surprise is that there was no surprise. The electorate has said we want the same, or at least that is the outcome of the election,” Laurent Muzellec, dean of Dublin’s Trinity Business School, told CNBC by phone. “However, underlying that, there is a frustration from a growing part of the Irish population that has not been captured in this election. It appears Sinn Féin haven’t captured this sense of frustration, seen in the fact that there was a low voter turnout of 59%. Talking to people, you have a different feeling than the result may indicate,” Muzellec continued. Chief among those issues is the country’s dire housing crisis which has seen an increase in homelessness, particularly in the capital Dublin, Muzellec said. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have made some commitments to increase housing supply, but the nature of repeated coalition forming means it is unknown exactly which elements of a manifesto will get enacted going forward, Muzellec noted. Some of that dissatisfaction may have been shown in exit polls in which only 27% named Fine Gael’s Harris as their preferred leader, compared to 35% for Fianna Fáil’s Martin and 34% for Sinn Féin head Mary Lou McDonald. Ageing infrastructure is another challenge for the country. The government has pledged to improve the situation through the unexpected 13-billion-euro ($13.7 billion) windfall it received earlier this year in back taxes from tech giant Apple. That adds to its budget surplus for the year, facilitated by hefty corporate tax receipts from multinationals including Apple, Google, Salesforce, Meta and Pfizer — all of which were drawn in by Ireland’s low corporate tax rate and have set up European bases in the country. Economists have questioned whether the country faces an economic threat from Donald Trump’s re-election in the U.S. as he threatens sweeping universal tariffs and a protectionist, “America first” stance. “Among all euro zone members, Ireland is by far the most vulnerable to a loss of U.S. trade,” economists Andrew Kenningham and Jack Allen-Reynolds of Capital Economics said in a note last month. U.S. demand accounts for around 1.5% of euro zone economic activity and 1.7% in German, versus 7% in Ireland, according to the research group, which says Ireland “sends a disproportionate share of its exports to the U.S.” “The economy may also be affected by U.S. corporate tax cuts if they persuade U.S.-based multinationals to shift their operations back from Ireland to the US. That said, we remain optimistic about Ireland’s economic prospects given its other strengths,” the economists continued. The latest election result confirms that there is no significant political movement in Ireland demanding its own protectionist shift away from its very open economy, Laurent Muzellec of Trinity Business School told CNBC. This sends out a sign that it is “still a good place to do business, still open to global companies, and as pro-business as it has been for the last 30 or 40 years,” he said. While the Trump presidency might impact the decision of companies in the future on where to set up, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry where manufacturing facilities are involved, there is very unlikely to be any kind of exodus, Muzellec continued. “For the big companies, they were initially here for tax reasons but they are now established with thousands of employees,” he said. “Many of those jobs are in sales and customer service for EMEA [Europe, Middle East and Africa] so they need to remain in Europe, so if they leave Ireland, where would they go? The U.K. is no longer part of the European Union, France is politically unstable — their other options are limited.”",CNBC,Center,839,"Lean Right  
The article presents a primarily favorable view of the incumbent center-right parties and emphasizes continuity in pro-business policies. While it acknowledges existing voter discontent and social issues, the overarching tone suggests support for the status quo and a stable economic environment, which aligns with a lean right perspective. The focus on the importance of low corporate tax rates and the business-friendly climate further reflects a right-leaning bias, as does the framing of potential economic threats."
7,Powell: Fed’s independence from politics is vital to its interest rate decisions,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the Federal Reserve’s ability to set interest rates free of political interference is necessary for it to make decisions to serve “all Americans” rather than a political party or political outcome. Speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook summit, Powell addressed a question about President-elect Donald Trump’s numerous public criticisms of the Fed and of Powell himself. During the election campaign, Trump had insisted that as president, he should have a “say” in the Fed’s interest rate policies. In his remarks Wednesday, Powell said, “We’re supposed to achieve maximum employment and price stability for the benefit of all Americans and keep out of politics completely.” Despite Trump’s comments, the Fed chair said he was confident of widespread support in Congress for maintaining the central bank’s independence. “I’m not concerned,” he said, “that there’s some risk that that we would lose our statutory independence. “There’s very, very broad support for that set of ideas in Congress, in both political parties, on both side of the Hill.” On the topic of interest rates, Powell said the Fed can afford to cut its benchmark rate cautiously, because the economy is doing better than the Fed thought it was in September, when it collectively predicted four rate cuts in 2025 after three cuts in 2024. “We’re not quite there on inflation, but we’re making progress,” Powell said. “We can afford to be a little more cautious.” The Fed has been aiming to deliver a “soft landing” for the economy, whereby the central bank’s interest rate hikes manage to help reduce inflation to its 2% target without causing a recession. History has shown it’s a rare and difficult feat. Yet the economy appears largely on track for such an outcome. The job market has slowed. And inflation is down sharply, though in recent months it has remained stuck modestly above the Fed’s target, which could make the policymakers reluctant to cut rates much further. Several other Fed officials have said this week that they expect to keep reducing rates, without committing to a reduction at their next meeting later this month. On Monday, Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed’s Board of Directors, said he was “leaning” toward a rate cut when the central bank meets in two weeks. Waller added, though, that if forthcoming data on inflation or hiring appears worse than the Fed expects, he might favor keeping rates unchanged. On Tuesday, Mary Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said she supported further lowering rates, without commenting specifically on a timetable. “Whether it’ll be in December or some time later, that’s a question we’ll have a chance to debate and discuss at our next meeting,” Daly said in an interview on Fox Business News. “But the point is, we have to keep policy moving down to accommodate the economy because we want a durable expansion with low inflation.”",APNEWS,Left,489,"Center

37,California farmers are hopeful Trump administration will deliver more water to fields,"Since winning the election, President-elect Donald Trump has been talking about immigration, border security and government efficiency. But in California farm country, his comments about water are also getting top attention. The Golden State grows three-quarters of the country’s fruits and nuts and more than a third of its vegetables, largely thanks to a complex network of dams and canals that funnel water to the state’s fertile Central Valley. In recent years, farmers have faced more limits on how much water they can access from this network because of environmental concerns, as well as on how much groundwater they can pump after years of overuse and drought. Now, farmers are hoping the second Trump administration will ensure more stable water flows to their fields from the federally managed Central Valley Project and a plan for future water supplies. Trump recently posted on his Truth Social platform a criticism of the “rerouting of MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF WATER A DAY FROM THE NORTH OUT INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN, rather than using it, free of charge, for the towns, cities, & farms dotted all throughout California.” “It is the number one issue,” said Jason Phillips, chief executive of the Friant Water Authority, which represents more than a dozen irrigation districts serving a large swath of the crop-rich valley. “You only need labor and you only need the products and the equipment and everything else to grow food if you have water.” California relies on water supplies from the Central Valley Project and the state-run State Water Project. The federal project provides 5 million acre-feet of water to farms each year and 600,000 acre-feet to cities, as well as water to maintain water quality in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which provides critical habitat to fish and wildlife. During the prior Trump administration, government officials issued rules to allow for a greater flow of water to California farms. The move was blasted by environmental groups. The Biden administration pushed back on those decisions and has been working on new rules aimed at balancing farming with protections for endangered wildlife such as the delta smelt, a tiny fish that is an indicator of the health of California’s waterways, and Chinook salmon. In recent years, California farmers said federal water allocations have been more limited than they feel is necessary after two years of ample rain boosted the state’s reservoirs. The state previously grappled with a yearslong drought that in 2022 saw the driest January-to-March period in at least a century, with scientists saying weather whiplash will likely become more common as the planet warms. That is a big concern of environmentalists and commercial fishermen, who want to see less water diverted to agriculture and more flowing to the delta. Salmon fishing has been banned off the California coast for the past two years because of dwindling stocks, and critics say Trump’s prior decisions moving water away from salmon-spawning areas are to blame. “They delivered all the cold water behind Shasta Dam. It literally cooked the baby salmon before they were hatched,” said Barry Nelson, policy advisor to the Golden State Salmon Association, a nonprofit focused on restoring California salmon. “Math is a brutal master, and we’ve hit physical limits on the amount of water we can take from the Bay delta, and the sign of that is the collapse of the ecosystem.” Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a long-time Trump critic, recently called on California lawmakers to gear up ahead of another Trump presidency to safeguard the state’s progressive policies. Environmental advocates, however, contend Newsom has not done enough to improve the situation in the delta for fish and wildlife. During Trump’s prior administration, Newsom opposed his rules for water flows, filing a legal challenge, but since then put forth his own rules, which Jon Rosenfield, San Francisco Baykeeper’s science director, said “were never that much different.” Competing demands on California’s water have led to numerous battles over who gets how much. Advocates for fishermen, environmental interests and farmers all say more must be done to shore up future water supplies. But what that looks like depends on who is asked, with proposed solutions spanning from more conservation to expanding water storage to technological upgrades. Aubrey Bettencourt, who oversaw Department of Interior water policy during the prior Trump administration, said she would like to see the system updated to respond to swings in climate rather than setting water releases based on the calendar. One of the issues, she said, is not how much water you get but knowing how much water you will get. “It makes it very hard to plan not just as a farmer but as a city manager,” she said. “I would expect an emphasis on restoring operational certainty.” The incoming Trump administration has discussed a series of economic policies that could also affect agriculture, including tariffs that could wind up affecting some exports and push up input costs for growers, according to a recent Rabobank report. But when it comes to water, many farmers in California are hopeful. Daniel Errotabere, a third-generation farmer and previous Westlands Water District president whose family grows tomatoes, garlic and almonds, is among them. As California ramps up limits on groundwater pumping, it is even more important to ensure a stable flow of surface water to grow the food the country is counting on, he said. Farmers have had to fallow fields and often don’t plant as much as they could because of water uncertainty, he said. “If electricity was delivered this way there’d be a revolt,” Errotabere said. “This is not any way to operate resources.”",APNEWS,Left,931,"Lean Right

You are way out of line!” [Ray] The final Congressional hearing on the assassination attempts on Donald Trump devolved into a screaming match regarding this year’s 9/11 remembrance ceremony. Congressman Pat Fallon accused Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe of putting the lives of President Biden, Vice President Harris and President-elect Trump at risk by attending the memorial ceremony as an agency representative rather than being on duty. Fallon: You know why you were there, because you wanted to be visible because you’re auditioning for this job that you’re not going to get. Rowe: I was there to pay respect to a fallen member of this agency. During the hearing, Rowe presented Congress with multiple changes he’s making to the agency in order to improve protection. The changes include the creation of a leadership development program. Rowe said they need to identify agents who will make good leaders before they get promoted to GS-15, which is the highest level a federal employee can reach before moving to an executive position. Rowe: We need to hit people and identify leaders earlier on, besides just saying, well, they’ve been here for 18 years, let’s make them a GS 15 Rowe will also increase training hours for agents so that it is “routine and expected”, which he describes as a culture change. Rowe: Somehow, along the way, we became disproportionately operational in comparison to time allocated for training. Rowe is also moving the office of investigations into the office of field operations which he says will increase the role of field offices for planning. Rowe said improvements are already underway thanks to the $231 million in supplemental funding Congress gave the agency in September. He said the extra money was crucial. Rowe: The Secret Service historically has had to manage its operations by doing more with less. It is not consistent with achieving a no fail mission.

Mike Rounds (R-SD) on Thursday struck an optimistic tone on President-elect Donald Trump’s Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth — a positive development given his reported skepticism. “Pete Hegseth went a long way today, in my opinion, in getting my full support. But I want him to be able to answer, in front of everybody else, the questions that are there,” he told reporters. Rounds also said, “I really do see a path forward for him to be successful in being accepted by the Senate for this position, but he’s got more work to do… I think he’s capable of doing that and I think the open hearings will help,” according to CNN. Rounds is one of 14 Republican senators who reportedly had concerns about Hegseth prior to his meeting with him. As is customary for cabinet nominees who are confirmed by the Senate, Hegseth is privately meeting with senators ahead of his confirmation hearing, which will likely be scheduled for next month. Hegseth began meeting with senators last week, and has spent every day so far this week meeting with them. Also over the last several weeks there has been barrage of hit pieces aimed at tanking Hegseth’s nomination, based on anonymously-sourced and unverified claims that date as far back as a decade. The latest smears have been that he has a drinking problem and mismanaged two organizations he led, but dozens who worked with Hegseth have come forward to dispute those allegations as lies and fabrications. Inside the Pete Hegseth Confirmation Battle with Matt Boyle Nevertheless, the hit pieces have caused some Republican senators to withhold support for Hegseth and float other potential nominees. However, in the past 48 hours, after Hegseth began fighting back in interviews and an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, and Trump reiterated his support for him, in addition to several dozen of conservative media figures coming out in force for him, more senators have come onboard with their support.

368,Fed immigration bigwigs all in on reopening Rikers’ ICE office amid ‘sanctuary city’ backlash: ‘Insanity needs to stop’,"A pair of federal immigration bigwigs on Thursday called for the long-shuttered ICE office at the Rikers Island jail complex to reopen — one day after The Post reported on a similar plea from a local lawmaker. “Reestablishing the [US Immigration and Customs Enforcement] unit at Rikers would would allow [Enforcement and Removal Operations] NYC officers to take direct custody of foreign born criminal offenders without the need to re-apprehend these criminals at large in the community,” Assistant Director of Field Operations Todd Lyons wrote on his linkedin.com page. ICE New York Field Office Director Kenneth Genalo followed up with his own post. 4 A pair of New York ICE officials on Thursday backed the idea of reopening the agency office at Rikers Island. Gregory P. Mango “Sanctuary policies only protect the criminals,” he wrote on his page. “This insanity needs to stop!” “The ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations office at Rikers Island closed in 2015,” Genalo said in a follow-up email to The Post. “No matter how well-intentioned, sanctuary policies protect criminals rather than the people of New York City.” He said that reopening the office would make it easier to deport dangerous migrants, “rather than expending five times the resources in time and personnel to re-apprehend them at large in the community.” Explore More UnitedHealthcare CEO was facing DOJ probe for insider trading when he was killed in targeted NYC shooting Message on bullets fired by health care CEO's assassin bears eerie link to book condemning insurance companies UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's suspected shooter used fake NJ ID to check into hostel: sources The feedback comes one day after The Post reported on a call from one city lawmaker to get the ICE office up and running for the first time since then-Mayor Bill de Blasio shut it down in 2015.

Mayor Eric Adams has voiced support for sanctuary city status in the past, but more recently waffled on the issue, suggesting that the restrictions should be loosened for law-breaking migrants. “Tough talk is good,” a skeptical Holden fired back this week. “But actions speak louder.” 4 Queens Councilman Robert Holden said this week that the ICE office at Rikers Island should be reopened. William Farrington A rep for Adams defended the mayor’s stance. “Mayor Adams has repeatedly said that while we will continue to respect our city’s sanctuary laws, we must also have a serious conversation about the small number of individuals who repeatedly commit violent crimes in our city and the consequences they should face,” the spokesperson said Thursday. “We must also fix this nation’s unsuccessful border policies that have led us to this place,” the emailed statement said. — Additional reporting by Craig McCarthy",NewYorkPost,Lean Right,559,"Lean Right

318,Secret Service agent opens fire near home of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in Washington,"A U.S. Secret Service agent opened fire near the Washington, D.C., home of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen after confronting several people who were trying to break into cars on her street early Tuesday morning, the agency said. There is no evidence that the agent, who was assigned to Yellen’s protective detail, hit any of the suspects before they fled in their own vehicle, the Secret Service said. Yellen was not under threat during the incident and was not harmed, the agency said. The shooting occurred nearly 13 months after a Secret Service agent assigned to protect President Joe Biden’s eldest granddaughter, Naomi Biden Neal, fired shots at several people who were breaking into an unoccupied government vehicle outside of her home in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C. The incident Tuesday outside of Yellen’s home, which is in the northwest section of Washington, occurred at about 1:30 a.m. ET, according to the Secret Service. The agent “observed a sedan with multiple occupants who were attempting to open car doors along the street,” the agency said. “As the sedan approached the agent, a confrontation occurred between the agent and the car’s occupants, the Secret Service said. “The agent discharged their service weapon.” “The suspects fled the scene in the sedan, and a lookout was issued to local law enforcement,” the agency said. The shooting will be investigated by the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington and Washington Metropolitan Police Department, according to the Secret Service.

0,Dobbs Was Just the Beginning. Now Trans Rights Are Being Tested at the Supreme Court.,"On Dec. 4, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in what is likely to be the most important trans rights case in history. It will have knock-on effects for civil rights jurisprudence that will affect the freedoms and protections of LGBTQ+ Americans, women, medical providers, and parents’ rights to raise their children without interference from the state. Tennessee’s S.B. 1 bans surgery, puberty blockers, and hormone treatment for the purpose of gender transition for people under 18. On Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick spoke to Chase Strangio, co-director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBTQ and HIV Project, who will argue United States v. Skrmetti. Strangio will be the first openly trans lawyer arguing at the high court. Their conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. Dahlia Lithwick: After Dobbs came down, you warned on this podcast about the ways the decision to overturn Roe had just rocket-fueled anti-trans legislation across the country. I would love for you to just remind listeners why Dobbs was never just about abortion and how it connects to the Tennessee ban in Skrmetti. Chase Strangio: They’re connected for so many reasons—whether you look at the equality thread or the autonomy thread in Dobbs, this is about structural efforts to impede people’s abilities to make decisions for themselves. The way in which Dobbs opened the door in particular for these anti-trans bans is that first they revitalized this case that was not talked about for a long time—although we know Justice Ginsburg hated it—Geduldig v. Aiello. This was the case in which the court said that restrictions on benefits related to pregnancy are not sex discrimination. The court allowed this idea to sit dormant for quite a while, but it was reactivated by Justice Alito in Dobbs. So now, when we are talking about things related to medicine, or health, or areas where we can claim that biological differences between men and women justify some differential treatment, we see the erosion of the protections we have worked so hard to build for sex-based protections under law. In the two and a half years since Dobbs was decided, people who have long wanted doctrinal openings to roll back antidiscrimination protections have found a group of people whom there is more public support to target, and they’ve used that to open the door to big possible doctrinal gaps in how everyone can be protected from sex discrimination. I see this happening very strategically. Within a week of Dobbs being decided, it was cited in every single anti-trans-related case we were litigating. And it was cited for the proposition that in essence, special deference is owed to legislatures when they are regulating in the area of medicine when it deals with sex-based differences between men and women. If we take a step back and look at this moment we are in, and the obsession with trans people during the 2024 elections, it wasn’t really about trans people. What it was about—the organizing theme—was about gender roles more broadly. They are using these attacks on trans people to re-entrench old notions of what is the proper role of men and women in society. I’m struck by how the two abortion cases before the court last year were in so many ways not about abortion per se, they were about physicians and their rights, and what kind of care they could give. And it is so striking to see a case like Skrmetti that’s essentially saying, “We don’t care what the parents think or what the doctors think.” It really is amazing that just as the parents are always right until they’re wrong, so too physicians—they’re always right, until they’re wrong. The throughline is this deep governmental trust in and reification of parental roles and physicians’ roles, until and unless those parents and physicians make decisions the state disagrees with. It’s not just an entrenchment of gender roles, it’s also this notion that doctors are the only important autonomous actor in the abortion context in both cases last year—but now, in Skrmetti, they’re just irrelevant. They’re wallpaper. There’s this stunning thing that we’ve seemingly just accepted, as a matter of public discourse, that not only are physicians wallpaper, they’re part of this vast and far-reaching conspiracy to provide harmful care. We’re talking about care that is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Endocrine Society, the American Medical Association. The doctors providing this care are at the most preeminent research institutions in this country, yet somehow the argument is they’re all conspiring to provide harmful care to minors. If we take a step back, that is quite a conspiratorial argument, and however people may disagree about, or feel discomfort about this, these are still good-faith parents and doctors trying to do right by their patients and their children. But we’ve somehow allowed this conspiracy to fester that actually everyone is just trying to provide harmful care, which is just absurd. You just listed a tiny number of the amicus briefs on your side from medical and mental health groups and serious scientific entities. This is not something they haven’t thought deeply about. All these professional organizations are on one side, and then, on the other side, the Tennessee brief is teeming with weird deep-state conspiracy theorizing. I worry because we have seen junk science and bad data infiltrate court doctrine and make its way into opinions that then get cited as though that junk science is real. It’s really scary, and I think it’s also a function of the fact that the courts no longer really care or look at the factual findings of the district court—they will just pull out the latest newspaper article that they see. There is an actual purpose to testing the evidence and seeing whether it holds up, because when we’ve actually gone to trial in these cases, and these witnesses are cross-examined, they have admitted they’re exaggerating, accepted that there’s no underlying scientific support for claims they’re making, pointed to the fact that perhaps it is speculative or based on internet searches or Reddit sites. This is why, when we look at the outcomes of these cases in the district courts—where the judges are the closest to the evidence—you have an almost unanimous set of holdings when heightened scrutiny is applied, that these laws [like S.B. 1] just don’t hold up. When you get more detached from the evidence and it becomes more about vibes, for lack of a better word, it becomes very untethered to what is actually going on, which allows people to say things like “Well, there’s no long-term studies.” There are long-term studies. There are studies that are tracking people for periods like six years, which is extraordinarily long in pediatric medicine. This medical research has been provided for decades—that isn’t “new” in medicine. I think about all of the innovations we’ve witnessed even in my 12-year-old child’s lifetime. So I think that so much of this is distortion and out-of-context polemics. And this is, again, a callback to the mifepristone case where the challengers were making claims as though no one has ever attempted to use these medicines before, even though there was decades of research. If there is a thematic, background set of principles that can come forth in our argument, it is that this is not the federal government displacing Tennessee. This is Tennessee displacing the loving, reasoned, painstaking decisions of parents who are trying to do right by their children. Children who were in anguish, and are now doing better, because of the health care Tennessee now bans.",SLATE,Left,1264,"Left  
This article presents a strong defense of trans rights and criticizes restrictive legislation like Tennessee's S.B. 1. It aligns with progressive ideals advocating for LGBTQ+ rights and emphasizes the importance of autonomy and medical care decisions made by individuals and families. The focus on systemic issues and adverse outcomes of anti-trans laws suggests a left-leaning media bias, as it highlights the perspectives of marginalized groups while critiquing governmental overreach in personal health and family decisions."
91,Voters Rejected Not Just Kamala Harris But Democrats’ Politics Of Division,"In the final tense days before the 2024 presidential election, a quiet confidence began to take hold. Shockingly strong polls, massive early voting crowds, a visibly panicked Democrat Party — this time around something just felt different. It was as if the ground was moving underneath the country; not splitting apart, but bringing it together. So big was this shift that when Donald Trump was declared the winner, it felt less like a victory for him, the Republican Party, or even the MAGA movement than it did the ultimate triumph of American unity over the craven politics of division. Voters of all ages and races from all walks of life and all socioeconomic backgrounds in all areas of the country came together to deliver Trump 312 electoral votes and a resounding win in the national popular vote. He didn’t just win; he won everywhere, improving his standing in nearly every geographic area and among every demographic group. He became the first candidate in 40 years to sweep the seven swing states and improved on his 2020 performance in nearly every state and 2,367 of the nation’s 3,243 counties and townships, according to New York Times data. He improved in urban counties by 5.2 percent, suburban counties by 4.3 percent, younger counties by 5.6 percent, and older counties by 4.9 percent. In counties with at least a 25 percent black population, he improved by 4.1 percent. In counties with at least a 25 percent Latino population, he improved by 9.5 percent. This fueled a massive nationwide shift towards him that even hit the most heavily Democrat states. Although Trump lost New Jersey by 16 percent of the vote in 2020, he narrowed that gap to just 5 percent in 2024. In Illinois, he lost by nine points after losing by 16 points four years ago. New York moved 12 points to the right while California moved 10, using the most recent data. The primary reason for this was that traditionally Democratic voters flocked to Trump in droves. Exit polling showed that he won 46 percent of Hispanic voters, including 55 percent of Hispanic men. He doubled his support among black men, winning 24 percent in 2024, and got nearly a third of all voters who identified as non-white. Younger voters, another core Democrat coalition, also moved dramatically to Trump. Forty-six percent of voters under 30 cast ballots for him, and so did 52 percent of men under the age of 45. Trump won middle-aged voters by a 52-47 margin and won seniors 51-48. Such strong support across all age ranges and races as well as geographic locations is perhaps best explained by the country’s profound socioeconomic shift. For more than a century, Democrats fashioned themselves as the party of the working class, but that is clearly no longer the case. Vice President Kamala Harris won majorities of voters who earn less than $25,000 or more than $100,000 per year, but Trump won everyone else. Fifty-eight percent of voters earn between $25,000 and $100,000 and Trump won 52 percent of them. This signals a fundamental realignment not just of electoral politics, but potentially of American society as well. For much of the 21st century, Americans have been divided along racial, ethnic, gender, and sexuality-based lines and believed the lie of systemic bigotry. To gain and maintain political power, Democrats split the populace into two classes: oppressors and the oppressed. Racial minorities, gays, and women were constantly told that they needed Democrat protection from the straight white men who would forever keep them down. It was no surprise that these men were the first to abandon the Democrat Party, but the speed at which other demographic groups are following them is shocking. Black and Latino voters, it seems, have grown tired of living in high-crime, low-income neighborhoods controlled by Democrats for decades, while women of all races are rejecting the patronizing supposition that the only issue they really care about is abortion. Younger voters, especially men, have always had a rebellious streak and yearned to rage against whatever machine they could find. Academia, the government bureaucracy, corporate America, and Hollywood have always been popular targets and now all are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Democratic Party as they mindlessly regurgitate left-wing dogma for mass consumption. Voters of all ages have begun to see through this and are rejecting it in record numbers. Just six percent of Americans say they have a great deal of trust in television news compared with 56 percent who have no or very little trust. Only seven percent trust newspapers, while 48 percent do not. Overwhelming and obvious leftist bias in coverage has given way to outright propaganda, and America has noticed. Yet the media is just the most visible entity under leftist control. Nearly all others have suffered the same collapse in public trust. Just six percent of Americans have a great deal of faith in big business compared with 42 percent who have no or very little faith. Eighteen percent have a lot of faith in higher education, while 32 percent have no or very little. The medical system, organized labor, public schools, and the criminal justice system all inspire trust in less than 20 percent of Americans and all are and have been under liberal control for years. The pervasive and highly justified belief that all of these institutions have not been honest with the public or acted in its best interests has coincided with the catastrophic failure of the Democrat government these institutions have all worked to protect. Sky-high prices for basic necessities, rampant crime in the streets, and a flood of illegal immigrants overrunning cities from coast to coast prompted two-thirds of voters to say the country is on the wrong track. Quite simply, those voters were tired of Democrat leaders failing them and Democrat-aligned institutions lying to them about it. To them, Trump didn’t just represent a change in America’s leadership but a change in America’s culture. They were tired of the media’s propaganda, academia’s indoctrination, big business’ “diversity, equity, and inclusion” agenda, the health care system’s corruption, the criminal justice system’s persecutions, and the entire American system’s surrender to the tyranny of the woke. They don’t want to be divided along demographic lines; they want to be united in the values and principles that have always underpinned American society: liberty, equality, hard work, family, faith, and community. They long for institutions and leaders who promote these ideals instead of mocking them or claiming that they are illusory. That, at its heart, is why Trump won such a resounding victory. He and his MAGA movement represent a return to a country in which Americans may not have faith in institutions, but they will always have faith in Americans. The appeal of this sort of country is universal, but there was a widespread belief that it was unattainable so long as Democrats kept Americans at war with one another. Trump exposed this deeply cynical ploy simply by being the dividing line. Democrats’ closing argument ahead of the election was that he is a fascist and, by extension, so too are his supporters. That isn’t an argument at all; it’s emotional blackmail. And Americans saw it for what it was. Record numbers of them across all demographic and geographic lines rejected the politics of division and instead found common ground in a return to their nation’s founding principles. Trump’s win really is no more complicated than that. It does, however, represent a radical political and cultural realignment that could drastically reshape this country for decades to come.",Federalist,Right,1262,"Right

157,To Restore Democracy Trump Will Have To Overcome Administrative State Tyranny,"In the wake of Donald Trump’s historic victory, permanent Washington’s hysteria is reaching new heights daily. “Federal bureaucrats wrestle with fight-or-flight response to Trump election,” reads one headline. Justice Department officials are “terrified,” according to another, fearing they may be sidelined, fired, or unable to “resist” as they did during the president’s first term. Pentagon officials are reportedly preparing their response to orders to “deploy active-duty troops domestically and fire large swaths of [purportedly] apolitical staffers,” another dispatch reveals. Several of Trump’s less conventional nominees, who hold views anathema to the bureaucracies they are poised to helm and threaten to disrupt them dramatically, have only further fueled the federal freakout. As unhinged as related stories from regime mouthpieces may seem on their face, one would be wrong to dismiss them as merely the Trump-deranged’s temper tantrum over a lost election. Rather, what these reports collectively illustrate is the hubris of unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. They foreshadow perhaps the bloodiest coming political battle in Trump’s war to restore Americans’ control over our republic. This will require overcoming myriad entrenched forces. First and foremost among them is the administrative state wherein these bureaucrats reside — an arguably unconstitutional branch unto itself that has usurped and combined the powers of the legislative and judicial branches, defining tyranny. The hubris among those in the administrative state is that they believe they know better than We the People, and that therefore they must substitute their policy preferences for our own by any means necessary. Who we voted for then doesn’t really matter because even when we give our elected representatives a mandate, the policy predilections of the “executive” agencies in-name-only must prevail. This is the true threat to democracy, and the dangerous status quo that has prevailed for too long and exploded into public view during the first Trump administration. The second Trump administration was elected as the antidote — to make radical, not incremental, changes in personnel and policy, and make the people sovereign again. Our ruling regime’s fear that Americans would self-govern rather than remain subjects explains why the president faced impeachments, indictments, and assassination attempts, among other attacks. The Department of Justice (DOJ) led the lawfare inquisition against Trump and those in his orbit, Jan. 6 protestors, pro-lifers, practicing Catholics, and engaged parents. It has effectively criminalized dissent. A hyper-politicized and weaponized DOJ is the death knell of the rule of law and justice in this country. The Department of Defense’s politicization at its highest levels is equally disturbing. It would be bad enough if, as Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, has lamented, lowered fitness standards and an emphasis on wokeness and “diversity, equity, and inclusion” eroded the lethality of our fighting forces. But as recent reporting suggests, we also face an apparent crisis of insubordination — a breakdown in the chain of command that poses a dire threat to our security. It is an invitation for our enemies to test us. News that some at the Pentagon plan to thwart the Trump administration comes on the heels of outgoing Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s Pentagon-wide letter affirming that the U.S. military stands ready to “obey all lawful orders from its civilian chain of command” under the new administration. The insinuation is that unlawful orders rather than simply disfavored policies might be forthcoming, and that the military would disobey them. In fact, resistance forces have been telegraphing such efforts for months, replete with “tabletop exercises” simulating a standoff between Trump and the generals, in what journalist Lee Smith hypothesizes represents a sinister plot to divide the military. This from a defense establishment whose former senior officials, arguably in violation of their codes of conduct, if not certainly in violation of the public trust, have attacked Trump as a fascist; a defense establishment from which hails the last chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who allegedly told Chinese counterparts he would tip them off to any coming attack and conspired with the former speaker to prevent Trump from using nuclear weapons; a defense establishment that played “shell games” to keep troops in Syria against Trump’s wishes. Resistance efforts of course are likely to span far beyond these agencies, and though they may take more “banal” forms — as a former Trump administration official recently told me — they will be no less corrosive to our republic. As James Sherk, a former top civil service reform advisor to President Trump on the White House Domestic Policy Council, has detailed, during Trump’s first term, bureaucrats across a raft of agencies commonly subverted the president’s policies through “withholding information, refusing to implement policies, intentionally delaying or slow-walking priorities, deliberately underperforming; leaking to Congress and the media; and outright insubordination.” This is precisely why Trump and his transition team have emphasized loyalty as perhaps the key criteria for those who will serve in his second administration. The media frames this in terms of bad faith, characterizing loyal staffers as toadies who will rubberstamp lawless acts. Set aside for the moment that the president has historically surrounded himself with people holding a diverse array of views — as with his initial slate of appointments this term — encouraged his personnel to debate them before him, and weighed all perspectives before making final decisions. And set aside that the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations actually engaged in the lawless and authoritarian actions that regime media dishonestly claims Trump would engage in in his second term. Loyalty means fidelity to the president’s agenda — dogged devotion to helping him execute the mandate for which we voted in the face of staunch opposition. This should be the bare minimum of what is required of personnel. It’s what every administration would expect of its staffers. It means that presidential personnel bring all of their skills and abilities to bear, provide their best possible advice, and when shots are called, do everything in their power to craft and implement policy as effectively and expeditiously as possible. What the media is implicitly saying, in referring to loyalty pejoratively, is that they want Trump to hire disloyal appointees who will sabotage, subvert, and stymie the duly elected president — to prevent the American people from getting the policies we voted for. The fear, in truth, is that if Americans get what we want, the ruling class will lose its power, prerogatives, and privileges. Every day, the incoming Trump administration will face resistance from uniparty congressmen, establishment judges, blue states, corporate media, popular cultural institutions, and beyond. But the first point of friction will always be with the Leviathan administrative state. The task for the Trump administration then will be to execute its agenda not only while the resistance challenges it in a thousand-front war, but with limited appointees, political capital, and time. Hiring cabinet and sub-cabinet officials who build teams firmly aligned with the president’s mission, comprised of those who are smart, tough, and will zealously work to fulfill the mission every day — prioritizing essential policy reforms, anticipating the ways they may be circumvented, and using every tool at their disposal to execute accordingly — is the first step towards overcoming the challenges at hand. Trump’s campaign also showed us the power of the bully pulpit — of the ability to go over the heads of all the hostile forces of propaganda and bring the message straight to the American people. That the president’s picks for vice president and cabinet have shown themselves to be compelling and charismatic speakers suggests the administration may well exploit these talents to maximum political effect. It would do well to do so. The future of our republic may rest upon these efforts.",Federalist,Right,1276,"Right

220,Supreme Court divided over FDA block on kid-friendly flavored vapes,"The Supreme Court on Monday was divided over whether the Food and Drug Administration had unlawfully rejected millions of flavored e-cigarettes for approved sale in U.S. over concerns about nicotine addiction among young people. During oral arguments in a case that could have a significant impact on public health, the justices grappled with tobacco industry claims that the government had given unclear and shifting requirements for new product applications and failed to provide proper notice to the companies. ""FDA switched its position on what studies were required"" to show that the products have benefits to existing smokers that offset risks to youth, argued Eric Heyer, the attorney representing vape manufacturers Triton Distribution and Vapetasia, which are seeking a green light to market e-liquids such as “Jimmy the Juice Man Peachy Strawberry” and “Iced Pineapple Express.” Federal law requires sellers of new nicotine products to provide regulators with scientific evidence to show that the products would promote public health, but the statute does not spell out specifically what evidence is necessary and sufficient. The FDA's guidance on how to meet that requirement is at the center of the case. ""Their argument is that the guidance were actually a moving target, that either they weren't clear or you changed the guidance as time went on,"" said Justice Clarence Thomas, who appeared sympathetic to vape manufacturers. ""That is their argument,"" replied Biden administration lawyer Curtis Gannon, representing the FDA, adding, ""But I think that the key point is that they knew from the statute that they needed to be making this comparison about what the benefits were with respect to existing smokers and weighing that against the potential costs with respect to nonsmokers and attracting youth."" Justice Neil Gorusch suggested that the companies might not have been given ""fair notice"" of how they could comply with the law. ""Wouldn't due process require an opportunity for notice and a hearing?"" he asked Gannon. E-cigarettes and vapes, which deliver nicotine without some of the harmful effects of smoking, have been booming in popularity. Kid-friendly flavors, such as fruit, candy, mint, menthol and desserts, are not approved by the FDA and are on the market illegally. While vaping among youth is declining, more than 1.6 million children use the products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 90% of them consume illicit flavored brands. Manufacturers have acknowledged that their products may appeal to youth but insist that a “growing body of scientific evidence” shows that “flavors are crucial to getting adult smokers to make the switch and stay away from combustible cigarettes.” A federal appeals court sided with the companies last year, saying the agency had acted arbitrarily. If the Supreme Court upholds that ruling, it could clear the way for broader marketing and sale of flavored nicotine products. The Court's three liberal justices all seemed to share the government's view that FDA did not illegally move the goal posts during the process and that the companies simply lacked the evidence to win approval. Since 2009, when Congress passed legislation aimed at curbing tobacco use among young people, the government has almost universally denied tobacco company requests to sell flavored nicotine e-liquids, citing risks of addiction among minors. The FDA said the two companies in this case provided insufficient evidence that the benefits of their flavored e-products in helping tobacco smokers quit exceed the dangers of hooking children. ""I'm so totally confused,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor told Heyer. ""What [FDA] said is what you provided wasn't sufficient."" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she was ""baffled"" by Heyer's argument because the FDA had explicitly articulated its standard. ""I guess I'm not really seeing what the surprise is here, or what the change is here,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. ""There's just not a lot of mystery here about what FDA was doing. You might disagree with that, because you think that, in fact, the world of 40-year-olds really wants to do blueberry vaping, but you can't say that FDA hasn't told you all about what it's thinking in this respect."" Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who could be a critical vote in the case, signaled sympathy to the industry's complaint about discretionary government regulation but suggested he wasn't convinced FDA had acted unreasonably. ""If the agency says [your claims of benefits to adult smokers] that doesn't outweigh the harm to youth, we've reviewed everything, we're aware of everything, of course they're aware of everything that's out there, that's kind of the end of it, isn't it?"" Kavanaugh asked. Even if they lose the case, several justices noted, the vape manufacturers could reapply for approval with the FDA in a new application. While the first Trump administration had taken a hard line against the marketing and sale of sweet and candy-flavored vapes, president-elect Donald Trump said during the campaign that he wants to ""save"" flavored vapes. ""We don't know exactly what that's going to look like,"" said Heyer. But, he added, that his clients ""can't afford to wait that out."" Nearly a quarter of high school students who use e-cigarettes consume illicit menthol-flavored varieties, according to the 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey. Josie Shapiro, the 2024 national youth ambassador for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids who testified before Congress on the dangers of nicotine addiction, said illicit flavored vapes hooked her at age 14. “I think that by marketing any sort of flavored product as bubble gum or any of the genres of candy, it's going to catch the eyes of children,” Shapiro said. “I'm still addicted, and I'm still trying to fight my addiction. Honestly, the FDA needs to regulate all flavored tobaccos to flavor ‘tobacco’ products and get them off the market.” Public health experts have credited the FDA’s restrictions on flavored nicotine products with helping to drive down the number of teenagers who vape gradually from an “epidemic” level just five years ago. The case, Food and Drug Administration v. Wages and White Lion Investments, LLC, will be decided before the end of the Supreme Court’s term in June 2025.",ABC,Lean Left,1004,"Lean Left  
This classification reflects the article's emphasis on public health concerns and government regulation over the tobacco industry. The strong critique of flavored e-cigarettes and the support for the FDA's position indicated an alignment with left-leaning public health advocates, while also presenting a skeptical view towards the tobacco industry's claims. The article highlights the risks of youth nicotine addiction and doesn't provide equal weight to the manufacturers' arguments, which is typical of a ""Lean Left"" perspective."
150,"Podcaster Alex Cooper Mocks Kamala Team Spending $100,000 on ‘Call Her Daddy’ Set: My Studio ‘Doesn’t Even Cost Six Figures’","Alex Cooper, host of the popular podcast Call Her Daddy, knocked the Kamala Harris campaign team for spending $100,000 to build mockup of her set, saying her own studio does not even cost six figures. Following the November election, in which Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in an Electoral College landslide, reports surfaced that the Kamala campaign spent over six figures to recreate the studio for Alex Cooper’s podcast. As Fox News reported at the time: The Harris campaign spent a massive sum of money for a podcast that got a fraction of the viewership President-elect Trump won on “The Joe Rogan Experience,” according to a new report. The Washington Examiner publish a report Friday with details on how the Harris campaign spent their $1 billion war chest, with one particular expenditure raising some eyebrows. “A source familiar with the matter told the Washington Examiner that the Harris campaign spent six figures on building a set for Harris’s appearance on the popular Call Her Daddy podcast with host Alex Cooper,” The Examiner wrote. “The interview came out in October and was reportedly filmed in a hotel room in Washington, D.C.” Speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit, Cooper said that her own studio set does not cost six figures and even said that the studio built by the Kamala team was not as “nice.” “The Harris campaign spent like $100,000. Do you know about this?” asked Andrew Ross Sorkin. “It’s hilarious,” said Cooper. While Cooper said “not true” in response to the story, it remains unclear if she was doubting the price tag or clarifying that the studio builders did not make a quality replica of her studio. “My studio that is gorgeous in Los Angeles doesn’t even cost six figures, so I don’t know how cardboard walls could cost six figures,” she said. “But do you think they did that?” asked Sorkin. “Absolutely not,” said Cooper. “With love to them. It was gorgeous, but it wasn’t that nice. It wasn’t like gorgeous marble. No. That was not six figures.” Alex Cooper faced blowback for hosting a soft-ball interview with Kamala Harris and recent news has shed doubt on her claims that she offered the Trump campaign an invitation to speak.

The article primarily focuses on criticism of the Kamala Harris campaign regarding its spending, using language that emphasizes the absurdity of the expense compared to the host's own studio. The framing of this story highlights a negative portrayal of a Democratic campaign while incorporating a conservative news source, the Washington Examiner, as a reference. This combination of elements suggests a lean towards right-leaning perspectives in its critique of the Harris campaign."
10,OpenAI’s Sam Altman ‘not that worried’ about rival Elon Musk’s influence in the Trump administration,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who is in a legal dispute with rival Elon Musk, said he is “not that worried” about Musk’s influence in the incoming Trump administration. Altman told a New York Times conference Wednesday that he “may turn out to be wrong” but he strongly believes that Musk will do the right thing. “It would be profoundly un-American to use political power, to the degree that Elon has it, to hurt your competitors and advantage your own businesses,” Altman said. “And I don’t think people would tolerate that. I don’t think Elon would do it.” Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company earlier this year alleging that the maker of ChatGPT betrayed its founding aims of benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits. Musk recently escalated the lawsuit by asking a federal judge to stop OpenAI’s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. President-elect Donald Trump is putting Musk, the world’s richest man, and Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate, in charge of the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is an outside advisory committee that will work with people inside the government to reduce spending and regulations. Musk, whose companies include Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X, has started his own rival AI company, xAI, that Altman said he considers a serious competitor. Asked about his frayed relationship with Musk, Altman said he felt “tremendously sad” but also characterized Musk’s legal fight as one about business competition. “He’s a competitor and we’re doing well,” Altman said. Altman also addressed another pending lawsuit against OpenAI from The New York Times, host of Wednesday’s DealBook summit of business and political leaders. The Times is among several news outlets that have sued San Francisco-based OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for copyright infringement in the use of news articles to train AI systems like ChatGPT. The companies have argued they are protected by the “fair use” doctrine of copyright law. “If an AI reads something — a physics textbook — it can learn physics, it can use that for other things like a human can,” Altman said. Lawyers for both sides gathered before a New York federal magistrate judge Tuesday for more than four hours to work out disagreements over how they would collect potential evidence from one another. Depositions are set to begin in January. A lawyer for the newspapers said in court that the publications have confirmed millions of news articles were used for AI training. “Look, I don’t believe in showing up in someone else’s house as a guest and being rude, but I will say, I think The New York Times is on the wrong side of history in many ways,” Altman told Times journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin during the on-stage interview Wednesday. “We could discuss and debate that and we’ll do that, I think, in court,” Sorkin responded, to laughter from the audience. ———- Associated Press writer Larry Neumeister in New York contributed to this report. ————- The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement allowing OpenAI access to part of the AP’s text archives.",APNEWS,Left,529,"Center

It includes quotes and perspectives from Altman, who expresses concerns about the ethics of political power but does not explicitly align with a particular political ideology. The coverage of legal disputes and the personalities involved remains neutral, without leaning towards or against either individual or their positions, which aligns with a centrist perspective."

Obama steps back into spotlight after election warnings about Trump ignoredUnmuteLoading Ad 00:00/01:19 LIVE A veterans group’s letter stating that Pete Hegseth resigned from the organization “voluntarily” as opposed to being fired has resurfaced. Randy Lair, trustee for Concerned Veterans for America, wrote a letter in January 2016 to Fox News, where Hegseth was a contributor, seeking to “set the record straight” about Hegseth’s departure. “The truth is Pete resigned his position as CEO of Concerned Veterans for America as a result of a difference of opinion as to the future of the organization and so that he could focus on other endeavors, including his relationship with Fox News,” Lair wrote in the letter. “Pete was not terminated by the organization and, in fact, we at CVA worked with him through this difficult decision and mutually agreed the end of 2015 was the best timing for both parties.” Lair went on to commend Hegseth for his “strong leadership” as head of the organization from 2013 to 2016. The letter’s resurfacing comes following a New Yorker article that outlined allegations laid out by a whistleblower within Concerned Veterans for America. The allegations, laid out in a seven-page document, accused Hegseth of engaging in drunken behavior at organization events and sexual impropriety with female employees. The report was first sent to senior CVA management in February 2015 and was later forwarded to Jae Pak, Hegseth’s successor, on Jan. 15, 2016, in an email with the subject line: “Congratulations on Removing Pete Hegseth.” The email outlined how Hegseth “treated the organization funds like they were a personal expense account — for partying, drinking, and using CVA events as little more than opportunities to ‘hook up’ with women on the road.” Hegseth has denied these allegations, and he wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, published on Wednesday, that the media is peddling a “smear” campaign on him. “They provide no evidence, no names, and they ignore the legions of people who speak on my behalf,” Hegseth wrote. “They need to create a bogeyman because they believe I threaten their institutional insanity. That is the only thing they are right about.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Hegseth was set to meet with several senators on Wednesday, including Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), which was expected to be one of the most crucial of his meetings as he needs Senate confirmation to become the next defense secretary. With Republicans holding a 53-majority in the Senate, Hegseth can only afford to lose three Republican votes to confirm his nomination, assuming Senate Democrats are staunchly opposed.",WashingtonExaminer,Lean Right,656,"Lean Right  
The article presents information surrounding Pete Hegseth, a conservative figure, and primarily defends him against allegations without deeply scrutinizing his actions. The focus on Hegseth's leadership and the veterans group’s letter, combined with the framing of outside criticism as a “smear” campaign, leans toward a right-leaning perspective, often characteristic of outlets sympathetic to conservative viewpoints. Additionally, the context around potential party interests reflects a bias favoring Republican narratives."
80,Calif. Reaffirms Commitment to Gender Transition for Kids,"California Attorney General Rob Bonta doubled-down on the state's ""unwavering commitment"" to providing irreversible gender transitioning treatments — including surgical procedures — for minors in the wake of arguments before the Supreme Court regarding Tennessee's ban on such measures. Bonta released a statement on Wednesday, the day the high court heard the case brought by the Biden administration over Tennessee's 2023 law — Senate Bill 1 — prohibiting the use of puberty blockers and other gender reassigning treatments for minors. ""My office reaffirms our unwavering commitment to protecting the health and rights of transgender individuals to access medically necessary care,"" Bonta wrote. ""Laws such as Tennessee's Senate Bill 1 are dangerous and discriminatory by denying transgender youth the critical, lifesaving care they need. Amid a growing wave of legislative attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, it is more important than ever to stand against these harmful measures."" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti on Thursday called out the ""dangerous"" language used by officials like Bonta, likening gender transition — ""lifesaving care"" — to suicide prevention measures. ""I mean, it's been very explicit: You can either have a dead daughter or a live son, or a live daughter or a dead son,"" Skrmetti told Newsmax on Thursday. ""People have been bullied into adopting the posture that this is good, because they don't want their kid to die."" He added, ""If the kids keep hearing that, I think it's dangerous."" From 2019-23, California performed more than 2,050 sex reassignment procedures on minors, according to watchdog Do No Harm. According to The Center Square, that was the most in the country. Submitted charges for those procedures came to nearly $29 million, or an estimated $14,300 per child, according to Do No Harm. Further, Do No Harm shows that three of the top 12 hospitals in the country performing these procedures are in California: Children's Hospital Los Angeles (Los Angeles) Rady Children's Hospital (San Diego) UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland (Oakland) ""And so recognizing that suicide is not inevitable as a result of not getting these treatments is really important for kids to make better decisions, for parents to make better decisions, for us to have a more realistic and balanced conversation about the risks and benefits of giving kids these drugs,"" Skrmetti told Newsmax.

353,Mega-ammonia project could position Louisiana as clean energy leader,"A proposed $7.5 billion ammonia production facility in Ascension Parish could position Louisiana as a global leader in clean energy. ""It would be the largest [ammonia production supply chain],"" Vee Godley, Senior VP of Clean Hydrogen Works, told the Clean Hydrogen Task Force committee. ""We're on a full build out."" According to Godley, key financial and logistical milestones have been completed, including budget finalization and other financing was completed in 2023. They have also begun permitting for eight trains to transport the ammonia. ""Right now, the total globe produces around 200 million tons, so that we're talking 150% increase in growth within a 25 year plan span,"" Godley said. The ammonia is also different from much of the supply in one crucial way. ""The difference between our product and the traditional ammonia is nothing other than the carbon intensity,"" Godley said. Both products are made through the same production process, but CHW captures carbon internally, never releasing it into the air. This is different from air capture technology, which people often associate with carbon capture. Instead of using scrubbers to pull CO2 from the atmosphere, the method contains the carbon within a closed system, something not possible with conventional ammonia production, where only some carbon can be captured. A central focus of the initiative is community engagement. The developers have established an office in Donaldsonville and created a community advisory panel to facilitate dialogue with local residents. ""You don't spend seven and a half billion dollars and shortcut the process,"" the representative emphasized, stressing the project's environmental integrity and transparency. The company is also launching workforce development programs, offering training and job placement to locals, including those facing barriers to employment. Godley also mentioned that the jobs will be well paying. ""We are building a project for the community, and the community can be proud of it,"" Godley said. The project includes a myriad of industry leading partnerships and investment. ExxonMobil will utilize its extensive pipeline network to capture and store CO2 emissions, Hafnia will handle global distribution, leveraging Clean Hydrogen Works strategic location near export facilities and the Mississippi River and Japanese transportation giant MOL will help deliver clean ammonia for use in global energy and industrial markets. A final investment decision is anticipated in 2025, with operations beginning in 2029. The developers selected Louisiana for its established infrastructure, workforce familiarity with the ammonia and hydrogen industries, and strategic access to global shipping routes. ""Ascension Parish is a fantastic place to be,"" Godley noted, citing its robust industrial base and cost advantages. Ammonia, traditionally associated with fertilizer, will serve broader applications, particularly in decarbonizing energy systems. Target markets include Japan, Korea, Europe, and marine transport. The facility's initial production will focus on energy-related uses such as reducing emissions in coal-fired power plants and steel manufacturing. The project has partnered with ExxonMobil for carbon sequestration. ExxonMobil's pipeline network will transport carbon dioxide emissions from the facility to secure storage sites. MOL and Hofnia bring logistical expertise to ensure ammonia is transported efficiently to global markets.",JustTheNews,Lean Right,505,"Center

137,EXCLUSIVE: Team Trump Promises Cabinet Nominees Will ‘Make America Safe Again’,"President Donald Trump’s cabinet nominees will “Make America Safe Again,” the president’s team said in a video first obtained by The Daily Wire.The video highlights the qualifications of Trump cabinet nominees Kristi Noem, Pam Bondi, Kash Patel, and Tom Homan, arguing that they bring a vast array of experience to the table — and that they will support Trump’s agenda to end the weaponization of the government against the American people, secure the border, and more.“President Trump was given a mandate to Make America Safe Again by securing our border, prosecuting dangerous criminals, supporting our police and Border Patrol, and rooting out corruption and crime,” Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told The Daily Wire. “President Trump’s nominees exemplify the leadership and experience needed to ensure the safety and security of all Americans.”WATCH:Advertisement“From Governor Kristi Noem’s proven record of upholding the rule of law, to Pam Bondi’s in combating crime and drug trafficking, these appointees are poised to restore integrity and justice across the nation,” Leavitt added. “Kash Patel’s expertise in protecting Americans from a range of threats and Tom Homan’s unflinching efforts on border enforcement demonstrate their readiness to tackle the challenges ahead. Together, they form a team dedicated to protecting our communities, securing our freedoms, and Making America Safe Again.”Noem is the governor of South Dakota, where the Trump team touts her work with the Department of Homeland Security, noting that she was the first governor to deploy National Guard soldiers to Texas to combat border crisis, which she did on seven other occasions. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has spent more than 18 years as a prosecutor and was the state’s first female attorney general.Homan is the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and has a long history of service with the department. And Patel is the former chief of staff at the Department of Defense as well as the former Deputy Director of National Intelligence.

191,"At Supreme Court, vaping may be frowned upon, but that could change with Trump","At the Supreme Court on Monday, the justices seemed skeptical about challenges brought by the vaping industry to regulations put in place by the Food and Drug Administration. Vaping is the tobacco alternative that is quite the rage among middle and high school kids, but also can help some adult smokers wean themselves off more damaging tobacco products, mainly cigarettes. If you don't know much about vaping, be assured that teenagers do. For the uninitiated in recreational stimulants, vaping is the inhaling of an aerosol mist from an electronic cigarette or similar device, which heats up a nicotine liquid to create a vapor that looks like smoke. It's an alternative that helps some smokers get off more damaging tobacco cigarettes, but it's also a product that's popular with middle and high-school kids. In 2023 over 2.1 million young people, including 10% of high school students, reported e-cigarette use and of those, more than a quarter reported daily vaping. The focal point of the case is 2009 law enacted by Congress that gives the Food and Drug Administration a mandate to curb the availability of nicotine products for minors. In the years since then, Congress has strengthened that mandate and the FDA has made it all but impossible for vaping companies to sell their products using flavors that appeal to kids, flavors like jimmy-the-juiceman-peachy strawberry, rainbow road, and mother's milk and cookies. The companies contend that the FDA has acted in an arbitrary manner, effectively setting standards that are a moving target. At the Supreme Court on Monday, the government's lawyer told the justices that Congress itself specified that flavored cigarettes and flavored vaping products have to meet a high bar because they particularly appeal to minors. Under the statute, a company must show its product is more likely to get adults off of tobacco cigarettes, and less likely to be used by under-age kids. To date, only 27 vaping products have been approved, out of hundreds of thousands of submissions, largely because the agency concluded that there was no way to allow flavored e-cigarettes to be marketed without harming large numbers of children. In the Supreme Court chamber on Monday, Chief Justice John Roberts asked Deputy Solicitor General Curtis Gannon, the government's lawyer, whether the government has ""an obligation to tell people what they have to do to comply with your regulation."" Gannon replied that the FDA gave these vaping businesses fair notice that their business model is a ""risky"" one. As to the evidence the companies presented, ""they were barking up the right tree,"" said Gannon, but ""they didn't have sufficient scientific evidence"" to satisfy the requirements in the statute. Gannon noted that Congress was concerned about the fact that most people who become addicted to nicotine start when they are under age, ""at a time when the adolescent brain is particularly vulnerable to the effects of nicotine."" Or as Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson put it in referring to the statute, ""This is not a discretionary call of the FDA."" Pressed by some of the conservative justices, Gannon pointed out that the agency approved not only tobacco flavored e-cigarettes, but most recently it approved e-cigarettes that are menthol flavored. The agency justified its decision on grounds that many smokers like the menthol taste, and menthol e-cigarettes deliver less damaging nicotine, and are more helpful for some adults seeking to wean themselves from the nicotine habit. Lawyer Eric Heyer, representing the vaping companies, told the justices that without the approval of more flavors, many small vaping companies will be forced to shut their doors. But Justice Elena Kagan replied that ""the difficulty with that, and the FDA I think has tried to document this, is that blueberry vapes are very appealing to 16-year-olds, not 40-year-olds."" Faced with the court's doubts, Heyer pointed out that once Donald Trump becomes president in January, the FDA's policy could change. With a new administration coming in, Heyer observed, ""the President-elect is on record saying, 'I'm going to save flavored vapes,' we don't know exactly what that's going to look like."" A decision in the case is expected by summer.",NPR,Lean Left,685,"Center

15,New LAPD chief says he will work to protect immigrants ahead of Trump’s plans for mass deportations,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The new chief of the Los Angeles police force said his department is working with consulate offices for Mexico and other Central American countries to draft a plan to protect immigrants ahead of the Trump administration’s plans for mass deportations. In an interview with The Associated Press, Jim McDonnell said his tenure as police chief will be marked by high engagement with the community, adding that all of society must participate in the criminal justice system to create a safe place to live. A veteran police officer and former sheriff, McDonnell was selected by Mayor Karen Bass in October and sworn in last month. The LAPD does not stop people or take action for any reason related to immigration status, and it doesn’t enforce immigration laws, a practice that has been in place for 45 years, said McDonnell, referring to a department policy known as Special Order 40 enacted in 1979. Any immigration enforcement would be “undercutting our primary mission, which is to be able to build public trust to work with every member of all of our communities, to be able to have hope that people will come forward if they were a victim of crime, a witness to a crime,” McDonnell said. The department plans to work with the consulates to create and circulate a video explaining their policies to the immigrant community and alleviating their concerns. During the last Trump administration, the U.S. Justice Department attempted to withhold funding from sanctuary cities and favor cities that pledged to cooperate with immigration enforcement for federal grants. McDonnell said the department is “cognizant of what’s at stake” –- with a majority of the LAPD budget going toward personnel, the police force often relies on grants to provide for equipment and tools. He will be working with national police groups like the Major Cities Chiefs Association to advocate for law enforcement needs with the Trump administration, McDonnell said. At the state level, Attorney General Rob Bonta is also preparing to protect immigrants from Trump’s mass deportation plans. The Democrat announced guidance Wednesday for schools, libraries, hospitals and other institutions on how to honor the privacy of immigrants without legal status and limit assistance to federal immigration enforcement. He said safeguarding immigrants’ rights is personal to him as someone whose family migrated from the Philippines to the United States when Bonta was an infant to escape the rise of martial law and dictatorship in their native country. “Here in California, we’re not going to spend our time, our money or our resources going backward,” Bonta said at a news conference in San Francisco. “Immigrants are the backbone of our nation. Immigrants make America great.” Along with engaging the immigrant community, McDonnell said he hopes to seek a greater level of engagement from communities that traditionally haven’t felt comfortable doing so, “just human-to-human, going out and asking for help.” He also vows to build back the police force from currently just under 9,000 sworn officers to a baseline of 10,000, ideally even exceeding that number. While recent recruitment class size numbers have been in the mid-30s, he hopes to double that to 60, McDonnell said. The additional officers will be crucial as Los Angeles prepares to play host to a number of events that will draw visitors from all over the world, including the FIFA World Cup in 2026, Super Bowl in 2027 and the Olympics in 2028. One additional tool in the law enforcement arsenal is the recent passage of Proposition 36, which reverted to a previous law making some shoplifting and drug offenses felonies again. While it will mainly affect prosecutors, McDonnell said it will make arrests for those types of crimes “more meaningful” and give local businesses more safety and comfort, preventing them from having to shut down their stores and leave the community. “As we move forward, we do so judiciously so that we use the tools that are available to us,” McDonnell said.

166,"Vivek Ramaswamy Plots His Next Move, With or Without Trump","Vivek Ramaswamy wants to be clear, or clear-ish: He says he doesn’t really know if anyone’s eating cats and dogs over in Springfield, Ohio, 45 minutes from his home in Columbus. But the hyperkinetic-MAGA loyalist is going to head to the town that became a political flash point after the outlandish Internet theory about Haitian migrants there went viral. Never mind that the bizarre claim — amplified by Donald Trump during the presidential debate — is false. As a divided America slouches toward Election Day, Ramaswamy is the same man the nation remembers: the preeningly ambitious, do-and-say-what-it-takes overachiever hungering for his shot at history. On this mid-September afternoon, he’s gulping down a bottle of Mountain Valley Spring Water — the same brand, not incidentally, that’s been served at the White House — after a round of tennis and a workout with battle ropes, and barefooting around his mansion. Propped on the mantle in the basement, beneath an American flag, is an image of Trump after his attempted assassination in July. Indian hand drums are nestled on the floor nearby. If he looks and sounds like a guy in a hurry, well, that’s because he is. Ramaswamy pads down to his basement studio for an interview about his latest book. Then up to his office for a conference call with John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser. Then back down to the basement for another interview. He talks so fast that Ramaswamy said Trump once joked he made his head hurt. Before long, he’s heading downtown to give a talk to the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. At age 39, and with a national profile few might have foreseen, Ramaswamy is on the cusp of — something. It was only nine months ago that he ended his long-shot campaign for the Republican nomination, where he prayed with Evangelicals and rapped to Eminem. Now, if Trump wins on Nov. 5, Ramaswamy might very well follow the former president back to Washington. There’s talk of a cabinet position, perhaps the Department of Homeland Security. Trump has vowed to deport millions of people living in the US illegally and has said that one the places he’d start would be Springfield. Ramaswamy declines to discuss his potential role in a Trump administration. And if Kamala Harris wins? Ramaswamy says he would accept the result of “a free and fair election,” even as Trump keeps claiming, with zero evidence, that the last election was “rigged” and this one might be too. “Whoever wins the election, wins the election,” Ramaswamy says. “I would commit to leading the Republican party to move past allegations of stolen elections.” But Ramaswamy is Ramaswamy: He’s also strongly considering running for governor right here in Ohio. As his SUV heads toward the colonnaded statehouse, the former biotech entrepreneur says he’d transform his home state, synonymous with Rust Belt despair, into the next low-tax Florida or Texas. “If other states have pulled it off and managed to get a boom of economic growth as a consequence, Ohio can too,” he says. Read more: The Anti-ESG Crusader Who Wants to Pick a Fight With BlackRock Another option, Ramaswamy says, would be to fill the Senate seat currently occupied by JD Vance, his former classmate at Yale Law, who Trump chose as his running mate rather than Ramaswamy. Whether it’s Plan A, B or C, Ramaswamy seems poised to reap dividends for pledging allegiance to Trump. Since bowing out of the presidential race, he’s bought a stake in media company Buzzfeed Inc. and cemented valuable connections in the MAGA-verse. The Trump campaign dispatched him to the “spin room” in Philadelphia to talk up Trump’s performance following the September debate with Vice President Harris. He’s also been stumping for Trump in swing states, helped to galvanize him on crypto currencies and visited Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where he said he helped the former president and his team craft a statement on abortion earlier this year. Today, Ramaswamy says he counts among his friends Elon Musk, Trump’s richest fan, whom he met last year at the home of venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya. Backers of Ramaswamy’s young investment firm, Strive Asset Management, include Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire who was an early patron of Vance, and Howard Lutnick, the Wall Street financier who happens to be helping to vet potential cabinet members for Trump. No one goes into politics without some measure of self-regard. But to say Ramaswamy projects assurance would be to understate the matter. He’s ticked the boxes: Harvard, Yale Law, business success and wealth. His first book, “Woke, Inc.” brought him to national attention. So did his role as an early instigator of conservative attacks against environmental, social and governance investing on Wall Street, as well as against diversity, equity and inclusion. Ramaswamy now argues that corporate diversity efforts have only fueled racial animus. Black Americans who get jobs on merit are often viewed as diversity hires, he says. “There’s an injustice of a different kind,” he says. Looking back, Ramaswamy says he was “chastened” that the announcement of his presidential run fell flat. But, like Trump, he’s developed a reputation as a political counterpuncher. Nicknamed “V-Dog” in high school because of his bulldog tenacity, he hits back hard when challenged — and keeps on coming. He says personal attacks against him during his run triggered his “gladiatorial instincts.” Now, just maybe, Ramaswamy has a second shot at power in Washington. None of this seems to surprise him. This, he says, was the plan all along. “It feels natural for me,” Ramaswamy says. “I feel like I am pursuing my calling.” Ramaswamy says his ambition and drive probably reflect insecurities that can come with being part of an immigrant family. He peers out the window of his SUV at the quiet streets of downtown Columbus and goes on: “They probably have roots in some sort of deep-seated experiences of inadequacy that make you want to make sure that you’re able to fight your way.” Ramaswamy brushes off the suggestion that he and Harris, whose late mother is from India and father is from Jamaica, might share something in common in that regard. Among other things, they speak the Indian language Tamil. Ramaswamy’s brusque retort: “But I’m very open about my heritage.” The comment echoes Trump, who’s falsely suggested that Harris “happened to turn Black.” When Ramaswamy got to Springfield last week, he spoke at a town hall-style event. The place was packed. He said he doesn’t blame migrants nor locals for the uproar (most Haitians in Springfield are in the US legally). Instead, he blamed the Biden administration’s immigration policies. Ramaswamy said in an interview afterward that he didn’t go there to talk about cats and dogs. This much is sure: Vivek Ramaswamy has a plan — several, in fact. Whichever one plays out, he says he wants to bring about “lasting change” in the US. And by “lasting,” the hyper-ambitious Ramaswamy doesn’t mean for the next four years. He means “over decades or centuries.” Nov. 5 will determine his next move.",Bloomberg,Lean Left,1177,"Lean Left

She said the pace has been fast, as Donald Trump works to build his administration: “It's incredible and we are very, very busy.” She's packing up so “we can start on Day 1.” She said her husband's attitude after his 2024 win was not the same as when he won in 2016. “The country and the people really supported him,"" she said. I think the energy is different. People around him are different.” She also praised her 18-year-old son Barron, crediting him with helping his father find new ways to reach the audience that elected him president. Trump has four other children. “He is a grown young man, I’m very proud of him about his knowledge, even about politics and giving advice to his father,"" she said. “He brought in so many young people.

64,Ex-Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio is set to testify at a retired police officer’s trial,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio is expected to testify on Thursday at the trial of a retired Washington, D.C., police officer accused of leaking confidential information to the far-right extremist group leader after Tarrio and other Proud Boys burned a stolen Black Lives Matter banner. WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio is expected to testify on Thursday at the trial of a retired Washington, D.C., police officer accused of leaking confidential information to the far-right extremist group leader after Tarrio and other Proud Boys burned a stolen Black Lives Matter banner. Attorneys for former Metropolitan Police Department Lt. Shane Lamond plan to call Tarrio as their first defense witness for Lamond’s federal trial on charges that he obstructed justice and made false statements about his communications with Tarrio. Justice Department prosecutors rested their case against Lamond on Wednesday. Tarrio is serving a 22-year prison sentence related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Donald Trump supporters. A jury convicted him and other Proud Boys leaders of seditious conspiracy for a plot to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power from Trump to Joe Biden after the 2020 election. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson will decide the case against Lamond after hearing testimony without a jury. On Monday, the judge said Tarrio was waiting for the outcome of last month’s presidential election before deciding whether to testify at Lamond’s trial. President-elect Trump, who repeatedly has vowed to pardon people convicted of Capitol riot charges, suggested he would consider pardoning Tarrio. Tarrio was sentenced to more than five months in jail for burning the banner that was stolen in December 2020 from a historic Black church in downtown Washington, and for bringing two high-capacity firearm magazines into the district. Tarrio was arrested in Washington two days before the Jan. 6 siege. The Miami resident wasn’t at the Capitol when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building and interrupted the congressional certification of Biden’s 2020 electoral victory. During the trial’s opening statements on Monday, a prosecutor said Lamond was a “Proud Boys sympathizer” who warned Tarrio about his impending arrest for the banner’s destruction and later lied to investigators about their communications. Lamond, who met Tarrio in 2019, had supervised the intelligence branch of the police department’s Homeland Security Bureau. He was responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to Washington. Lamond’s indictment accuses him of lying to and misleading federal investigators when they questioned him in June 2021 about his contacts with Tarrio. One of the government’s last witnesses was acting MPD Capt. Nicole Copeland, who supervised the police investigation of the banner burning. Copeland testified on Wednesday that it would have helped investigators to know that Tarrio had privately confessed to Lamond. The Proud Boys leader also publicly admitted on social media and on a podcast that he had burned the banner. Lamond, of Stafford, Virginia, was arrested in May 2023. He retired from the police department that same month. ___",APNEWS,Left,512,"Center

61,Trump’s Cabinet choices are dreadful. Why are so many Democrats in Congress quiet?,"Donald Trump’s nominees are without an iota of doubt the most appalling collection of choices any president has made to lead federal government departments. Multiple Trump picks have already withdrawn, and more may soon follow. Yet the response from Senate Democrats — who will have votes and a voice in the confirmation process — has been remarkably muted. Ask a Senate Democrat about the nominees, and you’re more likely to hear “I have some serious concerns” than the far more appropriate “My God, is Trump insane? These are the worst nominees in history!” Many of these Democrats would consider such a response uncivil and undignified; if Trump won’t adhere to norms of propriety, at least they will. Worse, they believe that it is politically clever for them to show voters that they seek bipartisanship, even if that desire turns out to be unrequited. “As I have long said, our preference is to secure bipartisan solutions wherever possible and look for ways to collaborate with our Republican colleagues to help working families,” Chuck Schumer, leader of Senate Democrats, said on social media. “However, our Republican colleagues should make no mistake about it, we will always stand up for our values.” Republicans are no doubt quivering in the face of such a blistering assault. This is a miscalculation born of a misunderstanding. Democrats need to grasp that during Trump’s second term, the electorate won’t be evaluating them either as individuals or as a party, based on whether they acted in good faith and sought areas of agreement with the GOP. The truth is: Voters don’t care about bipartisanship. They might tell pollsters they’d prefer it if everyone in Washington got along, and they may sincerely mean it. But when it comes time to vote, that’s not how they act. Opposition isn’t about how voters judge the opposition party; it’s about how they judge the party in power. The only evaluation from voters that matters for the next four years (and especially the next two years until the midterm elections) is that of Trump, his government and the Republicans who run Congress. In this situation, Democrats are not the alternative; their role is to oppose, loudly and unceasingly, and call attention to Republicans’ worst excesses. They need to disseminate the most cutting and critical messages and force the news media to address stories of the administration’s worst misdeeds. Let’s consider some relevant recent history. In the 2008 election, Democrats won 365 electoral votes, 251 House seats and 59 Senate seats — the most sweeping victory for one party in decades. Republicans could have decided that they needed to show the public they were committed to moderation and bipartisanship. They did just the opposite. On the very night of Barack Obama’s inauguration, GOP leaders gathered for dinner and planned to “show united and unyielding opposition” to the new president and his policies. A week later, House Republicans held a retreat where they committed themselves to all-out war against Obama; they cheered their recent unified vote against Obama’s recovery bill, and then-Rep. Mike Pence played a clip from the movie “Patton” of George C. Scott, as Gen. George S. Patton, rallying troops to fight the Nazis. In the Senate, Republican leader Mitch McConnell believed that bipartisanship had to be avoided at all costs, since it might legitimate Obama’s actions. Any tactic was justified in pursuit of opposition, up to and including refusing to allow a vote on the president’s Supreme Court nominee. The strategy was an extraordinary success: Republicans flipped 63 seats to take back the House in 2010 — the biggest switch in over 60 years. The Senate went to the GOP in 2014 and the White House in 2016, after which Republicans also secured a majority on the Supreme Court. The voters never punished them for being too partisan. It’s not that Democrats haven’t been capable of united and vigorous resistance. They implemented a similar strategy of opposition after George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, and as a result, they took control of both houses of Congress in the 2006 midterms. Their leaders at the time — Harry Reid in the Senate and Nancy Pelosi in the House — understood that their job was not to look for areas of agreement but to fight with every tool at their disposal. Which they did, and it worked. Yet somehow, today too many Democrats in Congress retain a conviction that it is important to “get caught trying,” to demonstrate over and over that they are making an effort to reach out and seek agreement. Ask President Joe Biden how politically effective the search for bipartisanship is. Few presidents have ever worked as hard, both in private and in public, to win opposition support, especially from his old colleagues in the Senate. On a few occasions he did succeed, winning some Republican votes for the infrastructure law he signed in 2021 and the CHIPS and Science Act in 2022. But Republicans never stopped attacking him in the most intense, personal and ugly ways they could, and voters never rewarded Biden for his efforts at bipartisanship — if they even knew about them. The confirmation hearings for Trump’s picks present a terrific opportunity for Democrats to define the Trump administration as both extremist and reckless, but it might be a mistake to get your hopes up. One example: The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will be hearing the nomination for defense secretary, is Jack Reed of Rhode Island. The 75-year-old Reed is well-respected, conscientious and a former Army Ranger. But watch him talking about the disastrous choice of Pete Hegseth to run the Pentagon and you won’t hear a powerful case against Trump, Hegseth or the risk they pose to American security. Other Democrats on the committee have offered similarly weak comments about Hegseth. That could be a harbinger of what the confirmation hearings for Trump’s Cabinet will look like. Democrats should carefully plan their questioning of the nominees to demonstrate how repugnant so many of them are and how dangerous their confirmations would be — not because they might persuade a few Republican senators to vote no, but because it’s a chance to send a strong message to the public about Trump and his cronies. Unfortunately, it may wind up being one more missed opportunity.",MSNBC,Left,1054,"Lean Left  
The article adopts a critical stance toward Donald Trump's cabinet nominees and the Democrats' approach to opposing them. It emphasizes the necessity for stronger resistance from Senate Democrats to effectively counter Republican policies and highlights the perceived failures of the current Democratic strategy. This analysis reflects a left-leaning perspective, as it favors a more aggressive opposition to Republican actions while portraying the current Democratic stance as weak and misguided."
239,FDA battles vaping industry at the Supreme Court,"The U.S. Supreme Court takes up the issue of vaping and e-cigarette regulation on Monday. If you don't know much about vaping, be assured that teenagers do. For the uninitiated, vaping is the inhaling of an aerosol mist from an electronic cigarette or other similar device, which heats up a liquid containing nicotine to create a vapor that looks like smoke. It's an alternative that helps some smokers get off more damaging tobacco cigarettes, but it's also a product that has become increasingly popular with middle- and high-school kids. William Schultz, who served for five years as the FDA's deputy commissioner for policy in the 1990s, says that the arrival of e-cigarettes has transformed a major public health victory into a major threat. ""When the FDA started regulating cigarettes in the 1990s, a third of kids smoked cigarettes,"" he observes, whereas ""now it's 2%."" That's the good news. The bad news is that ""in the meantime, e-cigarettes have filled the vacuum,"" he says. Indeed, in 2023, over 2.1 million youth, including 10% of high schoolers, reported e-cigarette use. The U.S. Surgeon General has found that ""nicotine exposure during adolescence can impact, learning, memory, and attention"" and can also increase risk for future addiction to other drugs, including a substantial risk of progression to cigarette smoking."" Of the high school kids who vape, 26.3% use an e-cigarette product daily. That jump is important because under a 2009 federal law, the FDA is charged with curbing the use of tobacco and nicotine products used by minors to prevent them from becoming addicted. Among the regulated products are e-cigarettes, which first entered the U.S. market in 2006. Monday's case is about how the FDA went about doing that. ""There's a concern that the FDA has kind of been operating in an ad hoc, unfair manner in the way it's been evaluating all these applications for what are literally millions of vaping products,"" says law professor Jonathan Adler, who has written extensively about this subject. Basically, the FDA has made it increasingly difficult for vaping producers to sell their products using flavors that appeal to kids. Flavors like ""pink lemonade,"" ""rainbow road"" ""jimmy the juice-man peachy strawberry,"" and ""suicide bunny mother's milk and cookies."" To date, only 27 products have been approved from a handful of companies, including large ones like Reynolds, NJOY, and Logic. Now, the vaping industry has gone to court to challenge FDA decisions not to allow millions of products on to the market -- products that the agency deems to be ""gateway devices,"" aimed at minors to introduce them to nicotine addiction. Seven appeals courts have, for the most part, approved the FDA's decisions and two have at least partially rejected those decisions. But one appeals court, the ultra-conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, rejected virtually every aspect of the FDA's decision-making process, eviscerating the agency's conduct as a ""surprise switcheroo"" in which companies were told that the FDA required certain studies, including marketing studies, but then changed its mind. The Fifth Circuit decision ""threatened to allow all vaping product manufacturers to put their products on the market and keep their products on the market,"" says Adler. What's more, he says, the decision had an additional and ""aggressive"" feature that ""threatened to make this decision the de facto rule for the country as a whole, one that would require the FDA to completely remake it's regulatory regime."" So, while the Biden administration had not appealed other adverse lower court rulings, it challenged this one full bore. And because even the FDA concedes that its regulatory guidance has evolved, it faces the charge that its conduct has been well short of ideal. The agency has not been clear about what the vaping companies must show to get the go-ahead for flavored e-cigarettes, says Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University. He notes that the FDA ""initially asked companies what they would do to prevent the marketing of their products to children,"" but the agency later decided ""it didn't think any restrictions on marketing would do enough so it stopped looking at those."" Basically, the companies claim that because the specific demands of the agency have been a moving target, the rules are arbitrary and capricious in violation of federal administrative law. Former FDA deputy commissioner Schultz has a different take. He notes that just as the agency in the past had to gain experience with earlier products and devices that it was charged with regulating, it has had a similar task in dealing with the explosion of vaping devices over just the last few years. Indeed, the FDA stopped looking at the marketing of vaping products to children because the agency concluded that there was no way to allow flavored e-cigarettes without harming large numbers of children. To date, the only flavored e-cigarettes the agency has approved for sale are those that are tobacco and menthol flavored. The FDA said essentially that those flavors are more likely to get adults off regular and far more dangerous cigarettes and less likely to attract underage users. The Supreme Court could rule in many different ways in the case, with experts saying the ultimate decision could be a narrow one. Keep in mind, though, that the conservative Supreme Court supermajority has not hesitated to redraw the regulatory map, and if it does so in this case, it could well open the floodgates to flavored e-cigarettes that greatly increase the number of kids vaping their way through middle and high school.",NPR,Lean Left,918,"Lean Left  
The article discusses the FDA's regulatory challenges regarding vaping and e-cigarettes, particularly focusing on public health concerns about youth addiction. It highlights potential risks posed by e-cigarettes, emphasizing the agency's need to protect minors over industry interests. The framing of the FDA as a necessary regulator to combat youth addiction aligns more with left-leaning perspectives that prioritize public health and government regulation over free market interests, while the criticism of conservative court decisions indicates a bias against right-wing judicial approaches."
40,Ron DeSantis Could Be Getting Another Season on the Trump Show,"Nominating Fox News personality Pete Hegseth to be secretary of defense was, from the start, one of the least serious choices Donald Trump made in assembling his broadly unserious slate of second-term Cabinet nominees. But information that has come out since Hegseth’s nomination was announced makes the selection look even less responsible. A newly published police report shows that he was accused of sexually assaulting and possibly raping a woman he met at a 2017 conference in California. (Local authorities concluded that there was not enough evidence available to bring charges, and he denies the allegation.) A New Yorker investigation found that he was forced out of two jobs leading veterans’ groups over “serious allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety, and personal misconduct” that included being heavily intoxicated at work events. (Hegseth’s attorney told the magazine that the claims were “outlandish” and blamed “a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate” for circulating them.) And the New York Times obtained an email written to Hegseth in 2018 by his mother in which she described him as someone who “lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego.” (Hegseth, 44, has been married three times. His mother says she regrets writing the email and that it does not fairly characterize her son.) The allegations themselves are obviously not disqualifying per se to Trump, who was found liable last year for defaming a woman that the jury determined he had raped in 1996, and was found guilty this year of committing fraud to cover up evidence of a sexual affair conducted soon after his third wife gave birth to their child. But he is reportedly peeved that Hegseth did not tell his transition team about the rape allegation, and has a long-standing suspicion of heavy drinkers that derives from his late brother Fred’s alcoholism. In fact, both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times are now reporting that Trump is annoyed enough with Hegseth, and skeptical enough of his chances of being confirmed, that he is considering bringing back a beloved character from previous seasons of the Trump Show to take the SecDef role instead: Yes … YES!!!! That’s our Meatball Ron, who rose to the dizzying heights of running about even with Trump in presidential primary polls on the strength of his campaigns against COVID precautions and wokeness … but then fell back to the dismal depths of having to actually manage the state of Florida after voters discovered that he is an awkward, over-scripted campaigner so ineffective that when Slate ran a piece about political strategists’ suggestions for improving his chances, we concluded that his two best options were “dropping out or becoming a different person.” He also once allegedly ate a cup of pudding with his fingers on an airplane. You’ve got Meatball Questions, we’ve got Meatball Answers: • But what about all the harsh things that DeSantis said about Trump during the primary, many of which were quite obviously true? Old stuff doesn’t matter that much to Trump so long as someone is willing to suck up to him in the present. • Is he qualified for the role? DeSantis served when he was younger as a Navy “JAG,” or judge advocate general, deploying to Iraq. While he never held a major leadership role in the military, by Trump administration standards, he is basically Dwight Eisenhower. • Would he actually want to do this? Sure—eliminating “wokeness” (i.e., diversity programs) from American institutions, including the military, has long been DeSantis’ main goal as a politician. It’s also an important and high-profile job and he probably wants to run for president again. • Is anyone else under consideration? Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst—who would be a much more qualified candidate, but also a less funny one—reportedly is. So that’s the lay of the land. And the stakes are high: In a normal administration, the secretary of defense is responsible for supervising the operations and maintaining the readiness of the United States’ armed forces, but in Trump administrations, he or she holds the even more important job of persuading the president not to invade Mexico, install himself as king, or order the special forces to conduct a “smash-and-grab extraction” of Rosie O’Donnell.

He also will meet with the family of Tony Ray Garrison, a fire battalion chief who died while rescuing victims of a Helene-related mudslide in late September. Outside of meetings and events surrounding President-elect Donald Trump’s transition efforts, the North Carolina visit will be Vance’s first trip since last month’s election. Vance surveyed Helene damage during an October campaign trip, touring storm-battered Damascus, Virginia. Appearing that day with Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a fellow Republican, Vance spoke about the importance of federal assistance to recovery efforts there and “especially North Carolina.” Vance also pledged to “do what we can to help this community and communities all across Appalachia rebuild.” Flanked by Youngkin and local officials as he took questions, Vance lauded FEMA for providing “a lot of resources,” while also arguing that President Joe Biden's administration “could be doing a whole lot better … making people feel like they matter.” “For so long, this community has been ignored, and they feel like their government is ignoring them once again,” Vance said. “We have got to change that.” Vance will soon resign his U.S. Senate seat in Ohio, where after taking office in January 2023 he became known for his responsiveness to local crises, such as the toxic train derailment in East Palestine and a string of tornadoes this year in western Ohio.",NBC,Lean Left,266,"Lean Right

44,'Machiavellian move': Ron DeSantis allies said to worry Trump is trying 'to kneecap him',"Donald Trump is reportedly considering Ron DeSantis to replace Pete Hegseth, if Hegseth drops out of the running to lead the Department of Defense, but some DeSantis allies worry that Trump is actually looking to punish the governor. DeSantis opposed Trump for the 2024 GOP primary, but immediately joined forces with Trump after being beaten. Still, some have said bad blood still exists between the two Republican politicians. DeSantis' name has popped up in conversations as Hegseth, a Fox News personality, is reportedly having difficulty with securing enough Republican votes to win confirmation. Politico did some in-depth reporting on exactly what such a switch would mean. ""POLITICO interviewed 16 Republican lobbyists, elected officials and political consultants tied to both Trump and DeSantis about the possibility of the swap, many of whom were granted anonymity to talk freely,"" according to the report. ""Many DeSantis allies see the Defense secretary job as being attractive to DeSantis, giving him the keys to run the world’s most powerful bureaucracy — and just as important, will keep him in the spotlight ahead of any potential future presidential run."" Some close to DeSantis call the move a ""win-win"" scenario, but others warn of pitfalls. The report says, ""But some DeSantis allies also think that Trump could just be floating DeSantis’ name to see how senators back in Washington react."" ""Such a move could be orchestrated to see whether the president-elect needs to choose a new nominee out of concern that Hegseth won’t get confirmed,"" it states. Politico reports that one ally ""who often talks to DeSantis’ inner circle"" said DeSantis and his team also ""had to decide whether to trust Trump knowing that he could join the administration and then get thrown out, perhaps even in a short amount of time."" ""The person described the scenario as DeSantis taking a risk — that he might on the one hand gain political longevity, but also that it wasn’t guaranteed given the possibility of angering Trump the way some Cabinet members did during the first term,"" the outlet reported on Thursday.

264,How Tulsi Gabbard Likely Bought Her Way Onto The Best-Seller List,"A political action committee tied to Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump’s nominee for Director of National Intelligence, spent $33,000 in 2024 on her then newly released book, For Love of Country: Leave the Democrat [Sic] Party Behind. The bulk purchases appear to have helped secure Gabbard a spot on the New York Times best-seller list. Gabbard launched Defend Freedom, Inc., a leadership PAC, in March 2024. The PAC reported no cash on hand until April 15, two weeks before the April 30 release of Gabbard’s book. Published by conservative imprint Regnery, the book blends memoir and political manifesto (“The Democrat [sic] elite deny the existence of objective truth and the biological differences between men and women,” she wrote. “In the ultimate expression of hatred and hostility toward women, and our Creator, they are trying to ‘erase’ our existence altogether.”). It debuted at No. 4 on the New York Times hardcover nonfiction bestseller list for the week ending May 4 but was flagged for bulk purchases (with a dagger icon), indicating that large orders may have influenced its ranking. For Love of Country remained on the list for one more week. At least some of those bulk purchases came from Gabbard’s PAC. On July 11, Defend Freedom made the first of four disbursements for “printing” to BulkBooks, a book wholesaler based in Franklin, Tennessee that specializes in large orders. The PAC would go on to direct $33,000 in donors’ funds to BulkBooks. A spokesperson for Gabbard confirmed that the PAC’s payments to BulkBooks were purchases of For Love of Country. “For a limited time, Defend Freedom PAC supporters who gave $100 or more received Tulsi Gabbard's NYT bestselling book For Love of Country,” said Erika Tsuji. An advertisement on Anedot, an online fundraising platform, shows that the PAC also packaged the book with tickets to a Tulsa, Oklahoma event headlined by “bestselling author” Tulsi Gabbard. As for why the PAC made the purchases from a wholesaler rather than directly from the publisher, which ostensibly would have been a cheaper option, Tsuji said that BulkBooks was able to fulfill and expedite the orders more efficiently. Purchases from BulkBooks were also able to help get Gabbard on that best-seller list: BulkBooks’ website says that its sales get reported to the New York Times. Authors typically receive royalties from books purchased wholesale, according to the Authors Guild, meaning Gabbard may have personally profited from the transactions. When asked via email if she did, her spokesperson didn’t comment. It wouldn’t be illegal, according to an attorney specializing in campaign finance. “She is not a federal candidate or an officeholder, so she is allowed to personally profit when her PAC buys her book with donors’ funds,” said Brett Kappel. Gabbard’s spokesperson also pointed out that her boss was not a candidate for elected office. “All FEC laws were followed in this process,” said Tsuji. Of course, just because a politician can profit off of donors’ funds, it doesn’t mean they have to. Former Vice President Mike Pence’s PAC, Great America Committee, spent $91,000 in 2022 to purchase copies of his memoir, So Help Me God. While Pence too could have legally profited from the deal, he did not do so, a spokesperson told Forbes at the time. For Love of Country sold 46,000 copies as of Nov. 23, according to Circana BookScan, an industry data service. It only tracks retailers though, so purchases from BulkBooks are not included in that figure. Through mid-October, Gabbard’s Defend Freedom, Inc. raised $1.9 million and spent $1.4 million, according to FEC records. In addition to books, most of its money went to credit card fees incurred when processing donations, direct mail and digital consultants.",Forbes,Center,613,"Lean Right  
The article focuses on a politically charged figure, Tulsi Gabbard, and critiques her PAC's financial practices in promoting her book. The tone appears to scrutinize her actions rather than celebrating or defending them, which could align with a more conservative perspective. The inclusion of specific financial transactions is presented in a way that could be interpreted as negative, indicating an underlying bias that aligns with a lean-right perspective on political accountability. The framing of political financing and ethical implications further reinforces this categorization."
330,"Trump-proofing: Biden officials strike deals, spend taxpayer money before Trump can stop it","President Biden’s breathtakingly broad pardon of his son’s criminal behavior is just one step the administration is taking to block potential action from the future president — what analysts call an attempt to “Trump-proof” government. Mr. Biden’s allies in various departments are rushing to push cash out the door and lock in policies they think President-elect Donald Trump will not favor. In an undercover video by Project Veritas, one Environmental Protection Agency figure said the agency had been funneling billions of dollars to climate change organizations “as fast as possible.” “It truly feels like we’re on the Titanic and we’re throwing gold bars off the edge,” said the person, identified in the video as EPA special adviser Brant Efron. A similar effort to shovel money out the door is underway at the Commerce Department. Politico, a news organization in Washington, said Secretary Gina Raimondo wants to “leave no cash for Trump” from a $50 billion microchip subsidy program. “I’d like to have really almost all of the money obligated by the time we leave,” she told the publication. “That’s the goal, and I certainly want to have all the major announcements done as it relates to the big, leading-edge companies.” At the Social Security Administration, officials confirmed they had locked in a generous telework agreement that allowed employees to work as little as two days per week in the office. The agency said that is essentially what they allow now. It said employees have increased productivity this year and are clearing disability case initial reviews faster than in years. At the EPA, officials said they are “on track to a timeline we set years ago.” “All of EPA’s grant awards are implemented in accordance with robust, consistent, and rigorous processes — consistent with the high standards of Federal ethics rules and EPA’s Competition Policy — and we ensure the fair and impartial treatment for external partners,” the agency said. Every administration does last-minute maneuvering. Among the more notable examples from the first Trump term was a memo that acting Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli signed with several Republican-led states. The memo purported to give the states a veto over major immigration policy changes unless they got a 180-day consultation period. He signed a similar deal with the labor union for deportation officers. Those agreements fared poorly in the courts when they were used to try to stop Mr. Biden’s early changes. Michael McKenna, a senior official in the Trump White House, said most administrations try to prove things against their successors, but usually at a slower pace. The Biden administration, however, has been slow-walking for years and is now rushing to finalize agenda items. Mr. McKenna pointed to an Energy Department clean energy loan guarantee program that had issued just $12 billion in loans over the past few years. Since the election, the department has been rushing to finalize tens of billions of dollars in new loans. Mr. McKenna, who also writes a column for The Washington Times, said a political reality is motivating the Biden zeal: Democrats fear they won’t retake the reins of executive power for some time. “This is the last helicopter out of Saigon,” he said. “There is a string of thought on the left that they might be in the wilderness for 8 or 12 years.” Mr. Biden’s pardon of his son was a major example of Trump-proofing. The president could have forgiven Hunter Biden’s tax and gun crime convictions, but the pardon covered anything else the Justice Department might bring against him. Seeing the closing window, activist groups are begging Mr. Biden to do more to constrain Mr. Trump. Immigration advocacy groups have called on Mr. Biden to shut down detention facilities to deny Mr. Trump deportation capacity. Some groups have even urged Mr. Biden to issue a blanket pardon to illegal immigrants. Activists hope to secure last-minute legal wins before the Trump administration takes power. Mr. Biden’s team is negotiating with immigration rights activists over changes to asylum rules that could bind Mr. Trump’s hands-on border policy. He could end those settlement talks if no deal is struck when Mr. Trump takes office.",WashingtonTimes,Lean Right,691,"Lean Left  
The article focuses on actions taken by the Biden administration to secure policies and funding before the Trump administration, portraying these moves as politically motivated and urgent. While it presents some criticisms of Biden's actions, the framing of the narrative emphasizes the urgency of ""Trump-proofing"" policies, reflecting a concern for Democratic interests. The use of quotes from sources with political motivations aligns more closely with a Lean Left perspective, as it views the Biden administration's actions through a lens of resistance to a Republican presidency."
235,Landmark Supreme Court case weighs gender-affirming care for trans kids,"Medical treatment for transgender children, endorsed by major American medical associations and safely used for decades, was the focus at the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday as the Biden administration and three families with transgender teenagers asked the justices to strike down a state law banning some gender-affirming care for minors. The landmark case -- U.S. v. Skrmetti -- comes from Tennessee, which is among 26 states that have moved to prohibit administration of puberty-blocking medication and hormone therapy to minors who seek to identify with, or live as, a gender identity inconsistent with his or her sex at birth. Oral arguments, which began just after 10 a.m., marked the first time the nation's highest court has openly considered a state law targeting transgender people. It is also the first time an openly transgender litigator, ACLU attorney Chase Strangio, argued a case in the Supreme Court chamber. The historic hearing thrusts the justices to the forefront of a cultural debate that has sharply divided the country and tested the limits of science and parental rights. The outcome of the case could determine access to health care for hundreds of thousands of trans teens and more broadly influence how communities treat transgender people in hospitals, schools and on sports fields. The government argues that Tennessee's SB1, which was enacted in March 2023, violates the Constitution's equal protection clause because it discriminates on the basis of sex to decide who can receive otherwise legal medical treatments available to youth. ""Put simply, an adolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or testosterone to live as a male, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can,"" the administration wrote in its brief to the court. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, kicking off the arguments, called it ""facial sex classification"" as she argued the high court should remand the case so the Tennessee law can be reconsidered under a higher standard of scrutiny that requires it serve an important government objective and be substantially related to achieving that objective. ""If you change the individual sex, it changes the result,"" Prelogar said. ""That's a facial sex classification, full stop. And a law like that can't stand on their rationality."" The Tennessee law expressly allows minors who are not transgender to receive gender-affirming treatments to address a ""congenital defect, precocious puberty, disease, or physical injury."" Denying discrimination, the state argues its law is a reasonable regulation of medical treatment based on its purpose, meant to protect children from potential long-term health risks and possible irreversible changes to the body. ""It's application on medical purpose, not on a patient's sex,"" Texas Solicitor General Matthew Rice said in defense of the law before the court. Rice contended the Constitution's equal protection clause ""does not require the states to blind themselves to medical reality or to treat unlike things the same, and it does not constitutionalize one side's view of a disputed medical question."" The law's Republican sponsors claim that contradictory scientific evidence and documented regret among some young people who have transitioned both warrant caution in developing standards of care. The law also cites a ""compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty"" and preventing them from becoming ""disdainful of their sex."" The government says the text proves an intent to enforce gender conformity. Chief Justice John Roberts questioned on Wednesday whether the Supreme Court was ""best situated"" to address evolving medical issues, or if they should ""leave those determinations to the legislative bodies."" Justice Sonia Sotomayor contended that any medical treatment carries risk. ""So the question in my mind is not, do policymakers decide whether one person's life is more valuable than the millions of others who get relief from this treatment? The question is, can you stop one sex from another sex from receiving that benefit?"" Sotomayor said. Hundreds of Tennessee transgender children were receiving treatments before SB1 was enacted, legislators concluded. It is not known how many suffered alleged harm. The plaintiffs in the case include 16-year-old LW and her parents Brian and Samantha Williams of Nashville. After several years of successful hormone therapy, LW now has to travel out of state to continue treatments she says have dramatically improved her quality of life. ""I feel normal now,"" LW said in an exclusive interview with ABC News last month. ""Our state legislature had made such a big deal out of parents rights during COVID, about masks and vaccines -- that that's for parents to decide these medical decisions for their children,"" noted Samantha Williams. ""And then, they made this medical decision for our child."" Nationwide, an estimated 300,000 Americans ages 13 to 17 identify as transgender, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law. Of those, nearly 100,000 live in states that have banned access to gender-affirming medical treatments for minors. ""It's a case of enormous significance that presents fundamental questions about the scope of state power to regulate medical care for minors, of the rights of parents to make medical decisions for their children… and the level of scrutiny that courts should apply to laws that discriminate against transgender people in general,"" said Deepak Gutpa, a veteran Supreme Court litigator. ""This is a major, major constitutional civil rights issue."" More than 60% of Americans say they oppose law banning certain types of gender-affirming medical treatment for minors, according to Gallup. Major American medical associations have endorsed the treatments for more than a decade as part of ""individually tailored interventions"" to support trans kids and affirm their sense of self. Not all transgender children seek medical care to facilitate transition to another sex. ""It needs to be part of a very deliberate process that involves medical specialists, who are expert at doing this, and, again, are following the science,"" said Dr. Ben Hoffman, a pediatrician and president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. ""It all begins and ends with science. This is not about any sort of agenda."" Clinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society, based on more than 260 research studies, recommend the use of puberty-delaying medications and waiting until a child reaches adulthood to consider gender-affirming surgery. The American Academy of Pediatrics says the effects of puberty blockers are not permanent if treatment is discontinued. Many effects of hormone therapy can also be reversed. Long-term risks may include fertility challenges and possible harm to bone density, but the group says those risks require further study. In contrast to the U.S. medical establishment, several European countries, including the United Kingdom, have reversed course on the use of gender-affirming treatments as a standard-of-care for transgender children, citing insufficient scientific evidence of long-term benefits. ""When you look at the totality of the medical research, to me there is more than enough uncertainty and evidence of bad outcomes for kids who've gone through these treatments when they reach the later stages in life,"" said Tennessee Senate GOP Leader Jack Johnson. A federal district court sided with the plaintiffs, temporarily halting enforcement of SB1, but the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals reversed. The panel of judges concluded Tennessee had a rational basis for enacting the law. ""Kind of the whole ballgame in the case is the debate about whether there actually is discrimination on the basis of sex,"" said Erin Murphy, a Supreme Court litigator and former clerk to Chief Justice John Roberts. ""It's really not,"" Murphy argued. ""To say providing testosterone to a biological boy and biological girl is the same thing because testosterone is involved -- it's a different treatment that has different risks."" David Cole, former legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the Williams family, says the court's conservative majority will have to confront the legacy of its decision. ""I think there's no question in 25 years that the court will have recognized that treating people differently because their gender identity is sex discrimination,"" Cole said. ""The question is whether the court wants to write a decision will be overturned, you know, in the course of the next 10 years or 15 years,"" he said, ""or whether it wants to recognize what is going on, which is sex discrimination.""",ABC,Lean Left,1358,"Lean Left  
The article discusses a significant Supreme Court case regarding gender-affirming care for transgender minors, presenting arguments that favor inclusive medical treatment and highlight the opposition as discriminatory. It references support from major medical associations and incorporates perspectives from both sides but emphasizes the harms of restrictive legislation and advocates for trans rights.

252,"Memphis police discriminate against Black people, US DOJ finds","Dec 5 (Reuters) - The Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people, the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday following an investigation, calling on the Tennessee city's police to undertake significant reforms. The federal investigation began in July 2023, in the wake of the beating death of Black motorist Tyre Nichols at the hands of Memphis officers. Memphis police conduct unlawful stops, searches and arrests, discriminate in responses to people with behavioral health disabilities and in its treatment of children ""who have experienced aggressive and frightening encounters with officers,"" the report said. A spokesperson for the Memphis Police Department directed inquiries for comment on the investigation to City Hall. A spokesperson for City Hall said they plan to hold a press conference on Thursday. Memphis City Attorney Tannera Gibson wrote in a letter to the Justice Department on Wednesday that city officials were not yet ready to negotiate reforms with the department, saying that they needed time to review the report's findings. Gibson wrote that the investigation ""only took 17 months to complete, compared to an average of 2-3 years in almost every other instance, implying a rush to judgment."" The city, Gibson added, could not yet agree with the Justice Department to ""work toward or enter into a consent decree"" - a court-approved settlement that typically commits police departments to systemic reforms and often involves oversight by an independent monitor for a number of years. In October a federal jury found three former Memphis officers guilty of witness tampering in relation to their trial for Nichols' death. The officers were cleared of the most serious charges that could have resulted in life in prison. Two other former officers had already pleaded guilty to federal charges and testified against their former colleagues in the trial.

71,'Deeply concerned': Biden considering preemptive pardons for people Trump may target,"Throughout the course of his third bid for the White House, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly promised to use the full powers of the federal government to prosecute his political enemies. Now, President Joe Biden appears to be taking those threats seriously. According to a Wednesday report by Politico's Jonathan Martin, Biden is now weighing preemptive pardons for several people Trump has directly targeted, including Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) — who won California's U.S. Senate race in November — and former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who was vice chair of the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack. Martin wrote that Biden was ""deeply concerned"" about the fate of the people Trump has singled out, particularly after the president-elect nominated Kash Patel to be the next potential FBI director. According to the Hill, Patel has referred to Schiff — who led Trump's first impeachment effort — as a ""government gangster,"" and has accused Cheney of being ""the main architect of this disinformation campaign."" READ MORE: 'Sinister deep staters': Even right-wing Republicans are on Kash Patel's 'hit list' ""[Cheney] and her band of miscreants suppressed evidence that completely exonerates the Jan. 6 defendants from their ginned-up charge of insurrection,"" Patel wrote in a May email. Biden is also reportedly weighing a pardon for Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Martin didn't name any other potential recipients of a preemptive pardon, but Patel is reportedly eyeing both Democrats and Republicans alike for prosecution, including former Attorney General Bill Barr, former National Security Advisor John Bolton, former Defense Secretary Mark Esper and other former Trump White House staffers who later opposed him publicly, like Sarah Isgur Flores, Alyssa Farah Griffin and Stephanie Grisham. ""If it’s clear by January 19 that [revenge] is his intention, then I would recommend to President Biden that he provide those preemptive pardons to people, because that’s really what our country is going to need next year,"" Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) told WGBH. Journalist Eleanor Clift recently called on Biden to issue preemptive pardons for Cheney and Schiff, along with former Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), who also publicly opposed Trump during the 2024 election cycle. Former Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly — who both called Trump a ""fascist"" — have also been recommended for pardons.

The article discusses President Biden's consideration of preemptive pardons for individuals targeted by Trump, a situation that invokes significant political implications. The framing of Biden's actions as a response to Trump's threats and the emphasis on Democratic figures highlights a critical tone towards Trump while demonstrating support for Biden's potential decisions. Additionally, the inclusion of Democratic voices advocating for pardons suggests a perspective more aligned with left-leaning sentiments, indicating a bias towards a pro-Democrat viewpoint without being overtly partisan."
12,"Trump names new point person for negotiating the release of hostages, detainees abroad","WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday named a health care executive to serve as his administration’s lead hostage negotiator at a time when the U.S. is trying to secure the release of prisoners in Gaza and other regions around the world. Adam Boehler will serve as the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. That role has been held since 2020 by Roger Carstens, who was appointed by Trump and remained in the job for the duration of the Biden administration. During that period, the U.S. has brought home several dozen Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained in countries including Russia — among them, WNBA star Brittney Griner and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich — Iran, China, Venezuela and Afghanistan. Boehler is the founder and CEO of Rubicon Founders, a healthcare investment firm, and also served as the first CEO of the International Development Finance Corporation. In a statement announcing the appointment, Trump described Boehler as the lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords team that strove to win broader recognition of Israel in the Arab world. “He has negotiated with some of the toughest people in the World, including the Taliban, but Adam knows that NO ONE is tougher than the United States of America, at least when President Trump is its Leader.

50,Pete Hegseth’s mother says The New York Times made ‘threats’ by asking her to comment on a story,"To The New York Times, it was a standard journalistic practice done in the name of fairness — asking someone involved in a story for comment. To the mother of the nominee for secretary of defense, it constituted a threat. To The New York Times, it was a standard journalistic practice done in the name of fairness — asking someone involved in a story for comment. To the mother of the nominee for secretary of defense, it constituted a threat. On Wednesday, Pete Hegseth’s mother accused the Times of making “threats” by calling about its story on an email she had sent to her son six years earlier that criticized his treatment of women. Penelope Hegseth sought and received an interview on Fox News Channel to support her son, whose confirmation chances are threatened by a series of damaging stories about his personal conduct. At one point, she said she wanted to directly tell President-elect Trump that her son “is not that man he was seven years ago.” She also called the Times “despicable” and attacked a basic tenet of journalism: giving someone the chance to speak for a story about actions that could be seen in a negative light. The Times’ story, published Saturday, quoted from a private email that Penelope Hegseth sent to her son in 2018 while he was in the midst of divorcing his second wife. She criticized his character and treatment of women, suggesting that he get some help. “I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego,” she wrote to her offspring. “You are that man (and have been for many years).” She told the Times for its story that she had sent the email in a moment of anger and followed it up two hours later with an apology. She disavows its content now. When the Times called her for comment on the story, Hegseth told Fox News that, at first, she did not respond. She said she perceived the calls as a threat — “they say unless you make a statement we will publish it as is and I think that’s a despicable way to treat anyone,” she said. “I don’t think a lot of people know that’s the way they operate,” she said, speaking about the story. She accused the newspaper of being in it “for the money. And they don’t care who they hurt, families, children. I don’t believe that’s the right way to do things.” Charles Stadtlander, a spokesman for the Times, said Hegseth’s claim “is flatly untrue,” and she was in no way threatened. “The Times did what it always does in reporting out a story, simply reaching out and asking for a comment, which we included,” he said. Such a call is the opposite of a threat — it’s an attempt to be fair, said Tom Rosenstiel, a University of Maryland professor and co-author of “Elements of Journalism: What News People Should Know and What the Public Should Expect.” “She’s basically saying that brake lights are a threat because they alert you that the car ahead of you is about to stop,” he said. But many Americans would perceive that call as a threat, or certainly as rude and a violation of privacy, said Tim Graham, director of media analysis at the conservative Media Research Center. “She didn’t write that email to be on the front page of The New York Times,” he said. A secondary question is the newsworthiness of publishing the content of the private email, one that Hegseth said she almost immediately regretted sending and doesn’t reflect how she perceives her son. Graham suggested that the newspaper wouldn’t do the same for the nominee of a Democratic president-elect. “The New York Times is out to destroy these nominees,” he said. In its initial story, the Times wrote that it had obtained a copy of the email “from another person with ties to the Hegseth family.” “This was a piece of independently reported journalism published in the name of public awareness of the nominee to lead the largest department in the federal government,” Stadtlander said. “We stand behind it completely.” In many circumstances, an email from a mother to her son would be considered a private matter and out of bounds to a news organization, Rosenstiel said. But in this case, Hegseth, a former Fox News weekend host chosen by Trump to lead the Pentagon, has built himself into a public figure and is up for a very important job — and one that leads the military, which involves waging war and in which character is considered a fundamental trait. “It makes this news, honestly,” Stadtlander said. The Times wrote about Penelope Hegseth’s Fox interview on Wednesday, leading with her saying her son “was not the same man he was in 2018 when she fired off an email accusing him of routinely abusing women and lacking decency and character.” There was some question about whether Hegseth would appear for an interview at his former network on Wednesday, after CNN’s Kaitlan Collins posted on X the night before that “multiple people” said that was expected. A Fox News representative said that no such interview had been scheduled, and the nominee was on Capitol Hill meeting with senators. He has faced a flurry of other damaging reports, including stories about a sexual assault allegation reported to police in 2017. No charges were filed then, and Hegseth said the relationship was consensual. The New Yorker magazine wrote about reports of financial mismanagement, sexist behavior and excessive drinking when Hegseth ran a veterans’ organization, and NBC News wrote about people at Fox News concerned about his alcohol use.

174,Transgender teen implores Supreme Court to strike Tennessee gender-affirming care ban,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The transgender Tennessee teenager behind a historic hearing at the U.S. Supreme Court this week doesn't want to show her face on television but is eager to speak about a case she says has the potential to make thousands of American kids feel ""seen"" for who they are. ""The court has definitely ruled in ways that would make me think that they don't exactly value bodily autonomy, but I have heard that they've been a little bit better about trans cases than people would think,"" said 16-year-old LW in an exclusive interview with ABC News alongside her parents Samantha and Brian Williams. The court on Wednesday will hear the Williams family's challenge to Tennessee's 2023 ban on gender-affirming medical treatments for minors, including puberty-blocking medication and hormone therapies that have dramatically improved LW's quality of life. While the medications have been used safely to treat minors of all genders for years, they are now prohibited in Tennessee when used to treat trans kids struggling with gender dysphoria, the distress experienced when one's gender assigned at birth is different from one's sense of identity. ""It's not very comfortable being trapped in [your body] because it just doesn't feel like you,"" said LW, who reports significant improvement since beginning the treatments in 2022. Since the state law took effect, LW now has to take time away from school to make a 10-hour round trip out of state to continue receiving care. The travel has also been a costly and time-consuming burden, her parents say. ""It would definitely be horrible for me to have to continue to go out of state to get care,"" said LW. ""I feel normal now."" Backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Biden administration, and major American medical associations, the Williamses sued Tennessee last year alleging the ban on certain gender-affirming treatments for minors discriminates on the basis of sex and overrides the rights of parents to make medical decisions for their children. ""Our state legislature had made such a big deal out of parents' rights during COVID, about masks and vaccines that that's for parents to decide these medical decisions for their children,"" Samantha Williams said. ""And then they made this medical decision for our child."" State lawmakers who support the law, SB1, say it is meant to protect kids from potentially irreversible effects from treatment and that contradictory scientific evidence and uncertainty about long-term adverse consequences warrant caution. ""We made the policy decision on behalf of our constituents that in Tennessee we think this is a risky procedure,"" said state Sen. Jack Johnson, the Senate GOP leader who sponsored the bill. ""It is our role as policymakers here in the state of Tennessee to set those guardrails."" The American Academy of Pediatrics says the effects of puberty blockers are not permanent if treatment is discontinued and that many effects of hormone therapy can also be reversed. Long-term risks may include fertility challenges and possible harm to bone density, but the Academy says those risks require further study. Worldwide, several countries which had previously embraced the treatments for transgender children have subsequently reversed course, citing unclear data about their purported benefits and alleged harms. In many of those places, the treatments remain available, but on a much more limited basis. In Tennessee, there are an estimated 3,000 transgender teenagers between ages 13 and 17, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School, which has analyzed Census data. It is not known how many were receiving treatments that are now outlawed or how many suffered alleged harm. A study published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics in October 2024 found the overwhelming majority of participants in a long-term survey of 220 transgender youths reported high levels of satisfaction and low levels of regret in the three to five years after receiving puberty blockers and hormone therapy. Major American medical associations have for more than a decade endorsed the use of puberty blockers and hormone therapy as part of ""individually tailored interventions"" to support trans kids and affirm their sense of self. ""It all begins and ends with science. This is not about any sort of agenda,"" said Dr. Ben Hoffman, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in an interview with ABC. Clinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society -- based on more than 260 research studies -- recommend consideration of medications to treat gender dysphoria in young people but waiting until a child reaches adulthood to consider gender-affirming surgery. ""It's crucial that there be a deep understanding of both the risks and benefits, and truly informed consent,"" Hoffman said. ""And for that reason, it is, by definition, going to take months or years."" The Williams family said the decision to use medication to delay LW's puberty followed months of careful consultation with medical experts and mental health providers. They said they grew worried that masculine changes to LW's body would compound her gender dysphoria. ""There is this time clock sitting here,"" said Brian Williams. ""The kids can go through puberty and it can have permanent effects on them. So these two things you're trying to balance at the same time."" ""She's not suicidal, but she shouldn't have to be suicidal, right?, to get the care that she needs,"" added Samantha Williams. ""When that really hit me, I was like, 'OK, let's do blockers. Let's get moving.'"" More than a year later, LW began receiving hormone therapy to better align her body with her gender identity. The course of treatment led to a reduction in discomfort. ""That was incredibly helpful,"" LW said. ""I feel amazing after that. You know, maybe it's just because the gender dysphoria was so bad."" The outcome of the case U.S. v. Skrmetti could have a sweeping impact on health care for the more than 300,000 American teens who identify as transgender, as well as the broader LGBTQ community. ""This is one of the most significant LGBTQ cases to ever reach the Supreme Court. I think this is an inflection point,"" said Chase Strangio, the ACLU attorney representing the Williams family. He will be the first openly transgender person to argue a case before the nation's highest court. ""Is this going to be a Bowers v. Hardwick type moment that sets off years of government legitimized discrimination against LGBTQ people? Or, is this going to be a Bostock moment that clarifies what we all have been assuming all this time, which is that LGBTQ people are protected under the Constitution and civil rights laws,"" Strangio said. In its 1986 decision in Bowers, the court upheld state laws criminalizing private same-sex conduct; it was overturned in 2003. The Court's 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County found that employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is illegal. Twenty-six states have laws banning gender-affirming treatments for minors, according to the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group. ""What concerns me as a physician is that legislators are going to be able to make decisions about a diagnosis, which is very unusual. I mean, that really hasn't happened,"" said Dr. Susan Lacy, a physician who specializes in hormone management and transgender care for teens and adults at her private practice in Memphis. Lacy, who is also a party to the Supreme Court case, agrees with Tennessee lawmakers that more research is needed on gender-affirming treatments for minors, but that a debate over the data shouldn't deny patients the chance to make an informed decision of their own. ""I think the most compelling thing is to listen to the patients,"" Lacy said. ""I have about 700 transgender patients out of about 3,000 total patients, and I have not seen anybody have a serious complication -- not one."" ""I think we're just at a point where we're still in the process of treating people and having studies that will give us more and more data to support this treatment,"" she said. Johnson said he hopes the Supreme Court will uphold an appeals court ruling that affirmed Tennessee's right to impose restrictions on treatments for transgender minors. ""States should be the laboratories of democracy,"" he said. ""We should be making the vast majority of decisions about what's best for our people, our constituents here in the statehouse."" The Williams family says care that has improved the life of their daughter should not be up for political debate.",ABC,Lean Left,1396,"Left

324,A growing chorus of Democrats calling on Biden to pardon Trump,"In the wake of President Biden’s pardon of his son Hunter Biden an increasing number of Democrats are calling upon him to extend executive clemency to President-elect Donald Trump. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania on Thursday became the latest Democrat to say a Trump pardon would be good for the country. During an appearance on ABC’s “The View,” Mr. Fetterman said he agreed with Mr. Biden that the legal cases against Hunter Biden were “politically motivated” — adding that was all the more reason to pardon Mr. Trump, too. He said that the same argument about politically motivated prosecution could be said about Mr. Trump’s conviction in New York, in which the president was found guilty on 34 counts of business fraud. “And in both cases, I think a pardon is appropriate, and I really think, collectively, America’s confidence in these kinds of institutions has been damaged by these kinds of cases, and we cannot allow these kinds of institutions to be weaponized against our political opponents,” Mr. Fetterman said. He added that it’s “very clear” that both the Trump and Hunter Biden trials were “politically motivated and weaponized” by the other side. The idea of pardoning Mr. Trump has gained increased popularity among Democrats following Mr. Biden’s broad and sweeping pardon of his son. Mr. Biden’s pardon absolved Hunter Biden of the consequences following his conviction on federal gun charges and pleading guilty to tax evasion. It also blocks prosecutors from bringing charges against Hunter Biden for any crimes he may have committed since January 2014. If Mr. Biden were to pardon Mr. Trump, it would be largely symbolic. Although Mr. Trump faced criminal charges for his handling of classified documents and his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, neither case made it to trial before his election. Late last month, special counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Mr. Trump, moved to drop both cases, citing a Justice Department policy that forbids criminally charging a sitting president. Mr. Trump’s New York conviction was on state charges, and presidential pardons only apply to federal cases. Mr. Biden would be unable to grant clemency in that case. Still, other Democrats have said the move, even symbolically, would be good for the nation. Rep. James E. Clyburn, South Carolina Democrat, told CNN this week that he’d support the pardon of Mr. Trump, saying others who called for it “may be on to something.” Outgoing Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a Democrat who recently switched to independent, also told the network that Mr. Biden should use his pardon power on the president-elect. “What I would have done differently and my recommendation as a counsel would’ve been, ’Why don’t you go ahead and pardon Donald Trump for his charges,’” Mr. Manchin said when asked about the Hunter Biden pardon. He said things would have “gone down a lot more balanced” if Mr. Biden had pardoned the president-elect alongside Hunter Biden. In addition, Douglas Schoen, a longtime adviser to President Clinton and a Democrat pollster and Robert Green, a Democratic strategist, authored an op-ed for Fox News saying Mr. Trump should receive a pardon. “Ending the cases involving the former and past president would put the country in a position to go forward and address more significant challenges such as the increasingly aggressive Russia-China-Iran axis, the Middle East, inflation here at home and more,” they wrote. “This would also display a level of equality and parallelism that would suggest to the American people that our elected leaders are capable of cooperation and working in the country’s best interests, two qualities Americans deserve,” they wrote. The White House and the Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.",WashingtonTimes,Lean Right,622,"Center

92,Exclusive — NYC Councilwoman Vickie Paladino on Daniel Penny Trial: ‘How Many Good Samaritans Is This Going to Turn Away’,"New York City Councilwoman Vickie Paladino fears that the blatant targeting of Daniel Penny — the U.S. Marine veteran on trial regarding the chokehold death of Jordan Neely in New York City — will turn other good Samaritans away, making the remarks during a Thursday appearance on Breitbart News Daily. “What stood out to me was how politicized the DA office is. She was a disgrace. She was a liar, she was despicable. She actually made it sound as if Daniel Penny had a mission to accomplish that day, and that was to kill poor, poor Daniel Neely,” Paladino said, referencing the mentally ill homeless man who allegedly screamed threats on a train in New York City, prompting Penny and others to intervene. “That is what she made it sound like, but she was hardcore, hardcore, progressive left-wing, tied to Black Lives Matter. She is politicized. She is the DA Bragg’s worst — one of his worst,” she said, noting that Bragg did not come in for the closing arguments of Daniel Penny’s attorney. “No. He came in for the second half of the day after lunch. And we sat there, my chief of staff and I, and he was right across the aisle for me, maybe eight feet from me, and to see this man up close. He’s sickening, and this is what he wants. He came in to listen to her crucify Daniel Penny. And it was — it was horrific. So how this young man sat there. He is a hero,” she said, explaining that Bragg’s office has a mission.

This was race-baited, make no mistake, because and they shove it in our faces,” Paladino said, explaining that the DA “turned it into something that it wasn’t.” “And with the frustration that you feel watching it, you have to understand there’s 12 people there, right?” she said, holding on to hope that just one has doubt. “And now I’m watching juror that were sitting back, sit up. [I’m] trying to read some body language there, praying for one juror to have the common sense to know that we need these good Samaritans. The police took eight minutes to respond. They were trapped in a subway car. This man came to a rescue. How many good Samaritans is this going to turn away now?” she asked. “People want to jump in and try to help. No, maybe they’re going to sit on the train and keep their earbuds in. Maybe Daniel Penny should have done the same thing, 26 years old today, and they’re going to decide whether or not you’re going to go to jail for 15 years protecting innocent people on a train,” she stressed. People deal with people every single day. You can’t move. The doors don’t open while the train is moving.

This article presents a generally positive view of cross-party collaboration, focusing on a Democrat joining a Republican initiative aimed at reducing government waste. It emphasizes the practicality of this effort, aligning with conservative principles of efficiency and fiscal responsibility. The mention of Trump and other Republican figures in a favorable light suggests a slight rightward lean, while the inclusion of a Democrat in the narrative provides a semblance of balance, though overall it still aligns more with right-leaning perspectives."
180,"With Trump on Deck, Europe Reaches for Its Checkbook","European leaders see Donald Trump’s return to the White House as a spur to the continent’s independence amid the potential weakening of a partnership that has shaped the world for most of the last century. “We can’t depend on U.S. voters every four years for our security,” Benjamin Haddad, France’s Minister Delegate for European Affairs, tells TIME. “Trump will defend U.S. interests—it’s normal. It’s now time to wake up and defend ours.” That sentiment, expressed in recent years by French President Emmanuel Macron and others, has gained a growing resonance in the weeks since Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, who had vowed to maintain the historical relationship embraced by President Joe Biden and every other post-war U.S. President save for Trump. In European capitals, observers say the shock many Europeans experienced after the 2016 election has given way to a more muted stoicism in 2024. Trump’s trademark unpredictability notwithstanding, Europeans are more clear-eyed about what they can expect from a second Trump term—in part because he’s already made his intentions clear. In wide-ranging interviews with TIME earlier this year, Trump pledged to take Europe to task on issues such as trade (“European Union is brutal to us on trade”) and defense spending (“I want Europe to pay”). He also vowed to end the nearly three years of fighting between Russia and Ukraine in as little as a day—an aim that some fear could involve forcing Kyiv to cede territories that Moscow has claimed as its own. Read More: What Trump’s Win Means for the World “We are much better prepared, because we know what awaits us,” says Nils Schmid, a German lawmaker and foreign policy spokesperson for the ruling Social Democrats. “As far as we can be prepared for an unpredictable president, but still. European unity is, of course, key in dealing with this.” Among Trump’s longstanding complaints is that Washington disproportionately foots the bill for European defense, a gripe that’s grown as the U.S. provided military support for Ukraine after Russia’s invasion. Europe is already on it. Several European foreign ministers have called on countries to “play a still greater role in assuring our own security,” including by surpassing the current NATO defense spending targets and reinforcing Europe’s industrial base. The sentiment was echoed by many of their defense counterparts, who this week pledged to ramp up their own military support for Ukraine. “The view is that we can’t be credible on Ukraine and expect Trump to take into account our sensitivities unless we’re willing to put a lot more money on the table,” says Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group consultancy. In doing so, he says, Europe will not only be better positioned to influence Trump’s thinking on Ukraine, it will also hand the president an early win by allowing him to claim responsibility for pressuring the E.U. to shoulder more of the financial burden for Ukraine—just as he did on defense spending within NATO during his first term. Georgina Wright, deputy director for international studies at the Paris-based think tank Institut Montaigne, says such thinking indicates a “shift in mindset” within the bloc toward the transactional thinking that defines Trump’s approach to foreign policy. “I think there’s much more realization on the European side that you need to have a credible offer,” she says. “If Europeans are going to ask the Americans for guarantees and security, a continued presence in Europe, but also to be kind to them on trade, they know that they’re going to have to offer something in return.” That thinking extends beyond security. On trade, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has reportedly floated the idea of buying more U.S. liquified natural gas as a means of avoiding Trump’s punishing tariffs. If the tariffs come anyway, the thinking goes, the strategy can shift to retaliatory tariffs on American-made goods, such as Kentucky bourbon, Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and Levi’s jeans. Observers are confident that the E.U. can remain united on trade: “When faced with something that’s going to hit the whole of the E.U., even when it hits some member states more than others, there’s actually a default to band together,” Wright says. Support for Ukraine also appears solid. Despite opposition from Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, the bloc has provided 122 billion euros, or $131 billion, in military and financial aid. But Europe’s two biggest powers are embroiled in domestic troubles. Germany’s government collapsed earlier this month amid disputes over spending and how to address the gaping hole in the country’s budget; it is preparing to hold fresh elections on Feb. 23, meaning that the next government won’t be in place til months into the incoming Trump administration. France, meanwhile, is currently embroiled in a debt crisis that threatens to plunge its government, as well as the eurozone, into crisis. A weakened Berlin and Paris doesn’t necessarily mean a paralyzed E.U., Wright notes. But Trump may opt—as he did during his first term—to bypass European institutions and deal with national leaders directly. This is where Europe’s chosen interlocutors will be key: Among those seen as key in getting through to the president includes Mark Rutte, the reformer Dutch premier-turned-NATO-chief whose rapport with Trump during the president’s first term earned him the moniker “the Trump whisperer.” Another is Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose conservative credentials have earned her plaudits within the MAGA movement, including from Trump’s incoming efficiency czar, Elon Musk. Most all European leaders appear to recognize that the incoming Trump administration presents an opportunity for Europe to pursue greater autonomy. “Do we want to continue to exist, to carry clout, or just be the passive theater of great power rivalries? That’s the question that Europeans must answer,” Haddad, of France, says. “In 2016, there was collective denial, that this was an accident of history, that things would go back to ‘normal.’ Now it’s time to wake up from our vacation from history.” Others caution that a more self-reliant Europe need not push away American security guarantees on which the continent remains very much dependent. Schmid notes that calls by Macron for the E.U. to overhaul its security architecture— in large part by relying less on American nuclear deterrence and more on France’s own nuclear stockpile—invites a continental version of the same risk that U.S. voters have twice driven home. “The French always push it too far,” Schmid says. “I think there's a large majority among European governments that prefer to have both a rock solid U.S. commitment to Europe’s security and a strong European defense. But exchanging the U.S. nuclear umbrella for the uncertainty of the outcome of the next French presidential election is not so promising.”",TIME,Lean Left,1111,"Lean Left  
The article primarily highlights European leaders' concerns regarding Donald Trump's potential return to power and their pursuit of greater independence from U.S. influence. It includes quotes from officials expressing desire for European autonomy while also mentioning Trump's transactional foreign policy approach. The tone is moderately critical of Trump but emphasizes a thoughtful European response, indicative of a Lean Left perspective that recognizes international dynamics but is cautious about perceived conservative policies."
210,"Trump Transition Says Administration Picks Targeted by Bomb Threats, Swatting Attacks","A number of President-elect Donald Trump’s most prominent Cabinet picks and appointees have been targeted by bomb threats and “swatting attacks,” Trump’s transition team said Wednesday. The FBI said it was investigating. “Last night and this morning, several of President Trump’s Cabinet nominees and Administration appointees were targeted in violent, unAmerican threats to their lives and those who live with them,” Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. The attacks ranged from bomb threats to swatting, in which attackers initiate an emergency law enforcement response against a target victim under false pretenses, she said. The tactic has become a popular one in recent years. Leavitt said law enforcement and other authorities acted quickly to ensure the safety of those who were targeted and Trump and his transition team are grateful. Among those targeted were New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, Trump’s pick to serve as the next ambassador to the United Nations; Matt Gaetz, Trump’s initial pick to serve as attorney general; Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, whom Trump chose to lead the Department of Labor, and former New York congressman Lee Zeldin, who has been tapped to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Read More: Here Are the New Members of Trump’s Administration So Far Law enforcement officials are also looking into whether Susie Wiles, Trump’s incoming chief of staff, and Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general whom Trump has chosen as Gaetz’s replacement, and other incoming administration officials were also victims—as well as how each was targeted, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity as the investigation continues. Wiles and Bondi did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The FBI said in a statement that it was “aware of numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting incoming administration nominees and appointees” and was investigating with its law enforcement partners. White House spokesperson Saloni Sharma said President Joe Biden had been briefed and the White House is in touch with federal law enforcement and Trump’s transition team. Biden “continues to monitor the situation closely,” Sharma said, adding the President and his administration “condemn threats of political violence.” Stefanik’s office said that, on Wednesday morning, she, her husband, and their 3-year-old son were driving home from Washington for Thanksgiving when they were informed of a bomb threat to their residence in Saratoga County. Police swept Stefanik’s home on Wednesday morning in response to the bomb threat but did not locate any explosive devices, New York State Police said. Zeldin said in a social media post that he and his family had also been threatened. “A pipe bomb threat targeting me and my family at our home today was sent in with a pro-Palestinian themed message,” he wrote on X. “My family and I were not home at the time and are safe.” In Florida, the Okaloosa County sheriff’s office said on Facebook that it “received notification of a bomb threat referencing former Congressman Matt Gaetz’s supposed mailbox at a home in the Niceville area” Wednesday. While a family member resides at the address, the office said, Gaetz “is NOT a resident.” No threatening devices were found. Gaetz was Trump’s initial pick to serve as attorney general, but he withdrew from consideration after allegations that he paid women for sex and slept with underage women. Gaetz has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and a Justice Department investigation into sex trafficking allegations ended with no charges against him. The threats follow a political campaign marked by disturbing and unprecedented violence. In July, a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing the then-candidate in the ear with a bullet and killing one of his supporters. The Secret Service later thwarted a subsequent assassination attempt at Trump’s West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course when an agent spotted the barrel of a gun poking through a perimeter fence while Trump was golfing. Trump was also the subject of an Iranian murder-for-hire plot, with a man saying he had been tasked with planning the assassination of the Republican President-elect. Also this week, authorities arrested a man they say posted videos on social media threatening to kill Trump, according to court documents. In one video posted on Nov. 13, Manuel Tamayo-Torres threatened to shoot the former President while holding what appeared to be an AR-15 style rifle, authorities said Among the other videos he posted was one from an arena in Glendale, Arizona on Aug. 23, the same day Trump held a campaign rally there, according to court papers. An attorney for Tamayo-Torres did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Public figures across the political spectrum have been targeted in recent years by hoax bomb threats and false reports of shootings at their homes. About a year ago the FBI responded to an uptick in such incidents at the homes of public officials, state capitols and courthouses across the country around the holidays. Many were locked down and evacuated in early January after receiving bomb threats. No explosives were found and no one was hurt. Some of those targeted last year were Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. The judges overseeing the civil fraud case against Trump in New York and the criminal election interference case against him in Washington were both targeted earlier this year. Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith, who recently abandoned the two criminal cases he brought against Trump, was also the subject of a fake emergency call on Christmas Day last year. Earlier this year, schools, government buildings and the homes of city officials in Springfield, Ohio, received a string of hoax bomb threats after Trump falsely accused members of Springfield’s Haitian community of abducting and eating cats and dogs. And in 2022, a slew of historically Black colleges and universities nationwide were targeted with dozens of bomb threats, with the vast majority arriving during the celebration of Black History Month. The U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement Wednesday that anytime a member of Congress is the victim of a swatting’ incident, “we work closely with our local and federal law enforcement partners.” The force declined to provide further details, in part to “minimize the risk of copy-cats.” Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson called the threats “dangerous and unhinged.” “This year, there was not just one but TWO assassination attempts on President Trump,” he wrote on X. “Now some of his Cabinet nominees and their families are facing bomb threats.” He added: “It is not who we are in America.” —Colvin reported from New York.

348,Iconic NYC dive Smith’s Bar to be replaced by weed dispensary near Times Square,"Old New York’s going up in smoke! Smith’s Bar, the iconic, neon-sign dive near Times Square, has closed for good and is set to be replaced by a marijuana dispensary — leaving broken-hearted regulars feeling burned. The beloved watering hole — where theater-going hipsters knocked one back alongside old drunks and businessmen for 70 years — shuttered for good last week on 44th Street and Eighth Avenue in Hell’s Kitchen. “It was a piece of history,” said Al Diaz, 49, an engineer who works nearby. “You don’t have things like this anymore, where you can sit and chill, like Cheers.” “Look at how old-school this is, look at these lights,” he added, gesturing to the building. “It’s like going back in time.” A cannabis dispensary will replace the 70-year-old bar.

But some neighbors are crying into their beers over plans for the new joint. “There are so many other dispensaries now. We don’t need another dispensary for marijuana,” Christopher Conkling, 71, who’s retired and lives nearby. “These mom and pop shops are going out of business,” he said. “It’s sad to see a piece of old New York go.” Others said they were happy to trade beers for buds. 35What do you think?

It reopened the next year under new ownership with Skip Panettiere at the helm, according to the blog w42st.com, which was first to report a weed dispensary would take over Smith’s.

346,Shouting match sends House task force hearing with Secret Service director off the rails,"A shouting match between Rep. Pat Fallon and Secret Service acting Director Ronald Rowe broke out during the final hearing of the House task force investigating the two assassination attempts on President-elect Donald Trump. Mr. Fallon, Texas Republican, accused Mr. Rowe of attending a 9/11 remembrance event for political visibility, igniting a loud, chaotic back and forth between the two men. Mr. Fallon was the second to last member of the task force to question Mr. Rowe at the hearing. Their exchange started normal but went off the rails when Mr. Fallon brought out a poster board with a photo of a 9/11 remembrance event with Mr. Rowe pictured standing near President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Mr. Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance were also pictured at the remembrance event on September 11 of this year. He asked Mr. Rowe who is usually closest to the president, security-wise. Mr. Rowe said that it is typically the special agent in charge of the presidential detail, to which Mr. Fallon asked if that was Mr. Rowe’s position. Mr. Rowe said the special agent in charge was just out of the frame of the picture and started to preemptively defend himself from where Mr. Fallon was going with the questioning. “That is the day where we remember the more than 3,000 people that died on 9/11,” he said. “I actually responded to ground zero. I was there going through the ashes at the World Trade Center.” Mr. Fallon started yelling that it was not what he was asking. Mr. Rowe yelled back that he was there to show respect for a Secret Service member who died on 9/11, which Mr. Fallon called “a bunch of horse hockey” as the shouting match continued and the men talked over one another. “Do not invoke 9/11 for political purposes,” Mr. Rowe said. Mr. Fallon responded he was not, saying, “I am an elected member of Congress and I’m asking you a serious question and you are playing politics.” “And I am a public servant who has served this nation and spent time on our country’s darkest day. Do not politicize it,” Mr. Rowe said. “You know why you were there — because you wanted to be visible, because you were auditioning for this job, which you’re not going to get,” Mr. Fallon said. “You endangered President Biden’s life, Vice President Harris’ life because you put those agents out of position. Did you have a radio with you? Did you wear a vest? Did you have a weapon? No.” Mr. Rowe responded: “I did sir, and you are out of line.” Throughout the intense argument, Rep. Mike Kelly, the task force’s chairman, banged his gavel trying to regain control of the hearing. The shouting finally ended after more than a minute, and the hearing concluded without further controversy. The outburst appeared to frustrate other panel members who have repeatedly touted the panel’s bipartisanship, its focus on the facts of the assassination attempts and its recommendations for improvement. Mr. Kelly, Pennsylvania Republican, spent time immediately after the exchange whispering with Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, the task force’s top Democrat. Later, Mr. Fallon came over to join in the conversation. It was not clear what they said to one another, but Mr. Kelly and Mr. Crow both used their closing remarks to praise Mr. Rowe for his cooperation and efforts to remediate issues at the Secret Service in the wake of the assassination attempt. Without directly addressing Mr. Fallon’s questioning of Mr. Rowe, they both said the hearing and the investigation adhered to their goal of a bipartisan fact-finding mission. “You couldn’t watch this hearing today and see who is a Democrat and Republican,” Mr. Crow said, suggesting the public watch the entirety of the hearing. Asked after the hearing how the shouting match over the 9/11 event conveys to the public the professionalism and seriousness of the members that the task force is trying to highlight, Mr. Crow said, “there are exuberances that occur when people get emotional about emotional issues.” “Acting Director Rowe was a first responder on 9/11, and as a combat veteran myself I understand that there’s a lot you carry with you throughout the rest of your life when you encounter a situation like that,” he said. “So I understand those exuberances and that emotion.” Mr. Fallon told reporters that his intention was to find out why Mr. Rowe was interfering with the positioning of the president’s protective detail. “The whole point I was bringing up was you guys have to learn lessons from July 13 so it doesn’t happen again,” he said. “And this happened in September, and clearly he didn’t learn it.” Mr. Fallon said he is unaware of any other time a Secret Service director stood right behind the president at an event like that. “I don’t think it’s ever happened before, and that’s coming from the agents that were talking to our office, that talked to me directly,” he said. “The whistleblowers made a good point. I didn’t know about this, and they brought it to me, and they’re furious.”",WashingtonTimes,Lean Right,853,"Center

5,Conspiracy theories and cosying up to dictators: why intelligence experts are spooked by Tulsi Gabbard,"In 2018, a Syrian dissident codenamed Caesar was set to testify before the House foreign affairs committee about the torture and summary executions that had become a signature of Bashar al-Assad’s brutal crackdown on opposition during Syria’s civil war. It was not Caesar’s first time in Washington: the ex-military photographer had smuggled out 55,000 photographs and other evidence of life in Assad’s brutal detention facilities years earlier, and had campaigned anonymously to convince US lawmakers to pass tough sanctions on Assad’s network as punishment for his reign of terror. But ahead of that hearing, staffers on the committee, activists and Caesar himself, suddenly became nervous: was it safe to hold the testimony in front of Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii congresswoman on the committee who just a year earlier had traveled to Damascus of her own volition to meet with Assad? Could she record Caesar’s voice, they asked, or potentially send a photograph of the secret witness back to the same contacts who had brokered her meeting with the Syrian president? “There was genuine concern by Democrats in her own party, and Republicans and us and Caesar, about how were we going to do this?” said Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, an activist group, who had previously traveled with Gabbard in Syria in 2015. “With the member sitting on this committee that we believe would give any intelligence she has to Assad, Russia and Iran, all of which would have wanted to kill Caesar.” During a congressional trip in 2015, Moustafa recalled, Gabbard had asked three young Syrian girls whether the airstrike they had narrowly survived may not have been launched by Assad, but rather by the terrorist group Isis. The one problem? Isis did not have an air force. Photographs from the 2018 briefing showed a heavily disguised Caesar sitting in a hoodie and mask giving testimony before the House committee. “I often disguise [witnesses],” said Moustafa, who had worked closely with Caesar and served as his translator. “But that day I was especially wary of Tulsi.” There is no evidence that Gabbard sought to pass any information about the Syrian whistleblower to Damascus or any other country, nor that she has any documented connection to other intelligence agencies. But within Washington foreign policy circles and the tightly knit intelligence community, Gabbard has long been seen as dangerous; some have worried that she seems inclined toward conspiracy theories and cosying up to dictators. Others, including the former secretary of state and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, have gone further, calling her a “Russian asset”. Those concerns have been heightened by Gabbard’s nomination under Donald Trump to the post of director of national intelligence, a senior cabinet-level position with access to classified materials from across the 18 US intelligence agencies, and shaping that information for the president’s daily briefing. The role would allow her to access and declassify information at her discretion, and also direct some intelligence-sharing with US allies around the world. “There is real concern about her contacts [in Syria] and that she does not share the same sympathies and values as the intelligence community,” said a person familiar with discussions among senior intelligence officials. “She is historically unfit.” Gabbard and her supporters have denounced those attacks as a smear, saying that her history of anti-interventionism in Syria and Ukraine has been misrepresented as a kind of “cold war 2.0”. In Washington, she has staked out a unique foreign policy position as a strong supporter of Israel and the “war on terror” – but also as a critic of US rivalries with countries like Russia and Iran (she strongly criticised Trump’s decision to assassinate the Iranian general Qassem Soleimani as an “illegal and unconstitutional act of war”). “When it comes to the war against terrorists, I’m a hawk,” she told a Hawaiian newspaper in 2016. “When it comes to counterproductive wars of regime change, I’m a dove.” Jeremy Scahill, the leftwing US journalist and activist, wrote that to “pretend that Gabbard somehow poses a more grave danger to US security than those in power after 9/11 or throughout the long bloody history of US interventions and the resulting blowback is a lot of hype and hysteria”. But Gabbard has repeatedly shared conspiracy theories, including claiming shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine that there are “25+ US-funded biolabs in Ukraine which if breached would release & spread deadly pathogens to US/world”. In fact, the US program stemming back to the 1990s is directed at better securing labs which focus on infectious disease outbreaks. Days after Russia invaded Ukraine, with Kyiv engaged in a desperate defense of the country’s sovereignty, Gabbard said: “It’s time to put geopolitics aside and embrace the spirit of aloha, respect and love, for the Ukrainian people by coming to an agreement that Ukraine will be a neutral country.” And she has repeatedly supported dictators, including Assad, suggesting that reports of the 2013 and 2017 chemical weapons attacks were false, and calling for the US to “join hands” with Moscow following its 2015 intervention in Syria. Establishment Democrats and Republicans have openly questioned whether or not she poses a threat to national security. “I worry what might happen to untold numbers of American assets if someone as reckless, inexperienced, and outright disloyal as Gabbard were DNI,” wrote Adam Kinzinger, a former congressman who served on the foreign affairs committee with Gabbard in 2018 when Caesar testified. The person close to the intelligence community said that there were continuing concerns about Gabbard’s contacts in the Middle East, stemming back to the controversial 2017 meeting with Assad – an encounter that Gabbard has insisted she does not regret. Those contacts may be explored during a Senate confirmation hearing early next year, the person said. Gabbard was briefly placed on a Transportation Security Administration watchlist because of her overseas travel patterns and foreign connections, CNN reported last month, but was later removed. She does not have a background in intelligence, although the Hawaii native served in the army national guard for more than two decades, and has deployed to Iraq and Kuwait. Moreover, there are concerns that her choice could affect intelligence sharing among US foreign allies, including the tightly knit Five Eyes intelligence group that includes the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand, as well as Nato and allies in Japan and South Korea. “Much of the intelligence we get, at least from the human collector side, is from our partners,” said John Sipher, formerly deputy director of the CIA’s Russia operations, noting that the cooperation was usually informal, “personality- and trust-based”. “They’re going to be really hesitant to pass [information] to a place that that is becoming more partisan and less professional … they would be making their own checklist: ‘Hey, this sensitive thing that we would in the past have passed to the CIA that could do us damage if it becomes public … Let’s just not do that this time.’”",TheGuardiadn,Left,1159,"Lean Left  
The article critiques Tulsi Gabbard's controversial foreign policy stances, her connections to dictators, and allegations of her spreading conspiracy theories, reflecting a perspective often associated with more liberal media. It includes quotes from establishment Democrats and Republicans expressing concerns regarding her qualifications and loyalties, which aligns with a left-leaning bias that critiques figures who deviate from mainstream Democratic viewpoints. However, it presents some nuanced examination of her principles without overt condemnation, indicating a lean rather than fully left stance."
228,Justice Neil Gorsuch Recuses From Case That Could Benefit Colorado Billionaire,"Justice Neil M. Gorsuch has recused himself from a case that is set to be argued in days after ethics watchdogs and Democratic lawmakers urged him to step aside because the outcome will likely affect the financial interests of a billionaire to whom he has longstanding ties. The terse disclosure, made in a letter from a clerk to the Supreme Court to lawyers involved in the case, did not specify a reason, saying only that the decision was “consistent with the code of conduct.” But the announcement, issued late Wednesday, was unusual for a case that the court agreed to take in June. The case involves a proposed railroad in Utah and an environmental regulation governing the project. Neither the billionaire, Philip F. Anschutz, nor his companies are a party to the case. But the railway would provide better shipping service to an area of Utah where Mr. Anschutz has oil wells, so he could benefit from an outcome favorable to the railroad company. And an oil and gas exploration company owned by Mr. Anschutz has filed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the justices to curtail the environmental rule at issue — a regulation his company must also obey when developing wells on leased public land. The brief says the rule has led to “absurd requirements” that cause “significant harms to the project developers and the economy.” Justice Gorsuch’s recusal is particularly significant for two reasons. During his 2017 confirmation to the Supreme Court, his web of ties to Mr. Anschutz attracted attention, raising questions over whether he would step aside in cases involving the billionaire’s business interests. He appeared to leave that door open, despite having systematically sought to recuse himself from such cases as an appeals court judge. Against that backdrop, Justice Gorsuch had been under growing public pressure to recuse. In October, ethics and watchdog groups, led by Accountability US, called on Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in an open letter to intervene. A month later, more than a dozen Democratic members of Congress sent a similar letter to Justice Gorsuch urging him to recuse. The recusal is also notable because it comes amid broader scrutiny on ethics at the Supreme Court, particularly after revelations that Justice Clarence Thomas, accepted — and sometimes failed to disclose — lavish trips and gifts from the billionaire Harlan Crow. Legislation to impose an ethics code on the justices has stalled, but in November 2023, the court unanimously adopted its first code of conduct. The New York Times has reported that in internal debate over the code, Justice Gorsuch insisted that it contain no enforcement mechanism beyond voluntary compliance. The code added some gloss to a vague 1974 statute that says justices should recuse themselves to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. But Supreme Court justices have argued that they have a heightened “duty to sit” for cases because there is no one to replace them if they step aside, unlike at the appeals court level. The court’s procedure is to let individual justices decide for themselves whether the standard for recusal is met; there is no appeal if they decide to stay on a case. While two Democratic-appointed justices, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, have since publicly cited the code in recusing from certain cases, the new letter appears to be the first time a Republican-appointed justice has publicly cited it, said Gabe Roth of Fix the Court, a group that has pressed for stronger ethical standard. Most recusals happen because justices own stock in a company or have another personal financial conflict, or because justices had presided over the same case at an earlier stage, when they were still lower-court judges, Mr. Roth added. Recusals for personal ties to people who could benefit from the case — Justice Gorsuch’s presumed reason, though the letter did not specify — are “very rare,” he said. Mr. Anschutz has myriad ties to Justice Gorsuch, a Colorado native. Early in his career, the future justice represented Mr. Anschutz and his companies in a variety of lawsuits as outside counsel. In 2005, Justice Gorsuch formed a limited liability company with two lieutenants to Mr. Anschutz, through which they jointly bought a 40-acre vacation property to share. Once Justice Gorsuch joined the Supreme Court, they sold the property to the head of a major law firm. In 2006, Mr. Anschutz, a major conservative donor, played a major role in helping Justice Gorsuch secure President George W. Bush’s nomination to a seat on the federal appeals court in Denver. And after joining the appeals court, Judge Gorsuch appeared as a keynote speaker at the billionaires’s annual dove hunt parties at his ranch. Caroline Ciccone, the president of Accountable US, which first raised public alarms about the matter, pressed for the Supreme Court to have greater transparency and more enforceable ethical standards. “Justice Gorsuch only recused himself after this glaring conflict was brought to light,” she said in a statement, adding: “This recusal is another reminder of how the justices’ cozy relationships with billionaires and special interests continue to plague the Supreme Court and keep public trust in the court at an all-time low.” Still, Mr. Roth praised the decision. “Part of the recusal statute and the code of conduct says that a justice should recuse if their impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” Mr. Roth said, adding, “Given all of Gorsuch’s ties to Philip Anschutz and his companies, a reasonable person might impute bias. I think it is absolutely the right call.”",NYTimes,Lean Left,919,"Lean Left  
The article emphasizes the scrutiny of Justice Gorsuch's ties to a billionaire and the ethical implications of his involvement in a case that could advantage him financially. This narrative is supported by quotes from watchdog groups and Democratic lawmakers, which reflects a progressive concern for ethics in the Supreme Court. The focus on potential conflicts of interest and the heightened public pressure for accountability aligns with a left-leaning perspective, leaning more towards challenging conservative legal norms rather than simply presenting facts without bias."
254,"Lebanon had ‘no say in the decision to go to war,’ foreign minister says","Lebanon’s foreign minister on Thursday defended Hezbollah’s presence in the region, but said his country had “no say in the decision to go to war” with Israel. Speaking to CNBC’s Dan Murphy, Abdallah Bou Habib vowed to uphold a U.S.-France brokered cease-fire that is already showing signs of strain, and said he will seek foreign funding to assist in the reconstruction of Lebanon. “We support Hezbollah, but we don’t support the war as Lebanese, and the government had no say in the decision to go to war, we have to admit that,” he said. Hezbollah, which operates as both a political party and a paramilitary group, has been accused of dragging Lebanon, a country of over 5 million, into a war it did not want to fight with Israel. The Iran-backed militia, which holds 13 seats officially but has a wider alliance that makes up 62 seats in Lebanon’s 128-member parliament, also controls much of Lebanon’s borders and its airport. “Iran has influence through Hezbollah on Lebanon,” Bou Habib told CNBC, “but Hezbollah does not run Lebanon” he added. “This government is not under the influence of Iran, Iran has allies in Lebanon, no doubt about that.” Hezbollah “will implement” the cease-fire agreement “faithfully,” Bou Habib, said after the French and American-brokered deal, which took effect Wednesday, allowed displaced Israelis and Lebanese to return home after 14 months of intense conflict. Both Israel and Hezbollah have accused each other of breaching the cease-fire agreement less than 48 hours after it was agreed. Lebanon is “ready, willing and determined” to implement UN resolution 1701, Bou Habib said, which aims to ensure Israeli withdrawal from the south and move Hezbollah north of the Litani River. The area, under 1701, would fall under Lebanese Armed Forces control and a U.N. peacekeeping force. Under the current cease-fire agreement, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and Hezbollah from southern Lebanon would occur gradually over the next 60 days, which U.S. Envoy Amos Hochstein told CNBC on Wednesday he hopes will become permanent. The Lebanese Cabinet also reaffirmed their commitment to 1701, which, under previous UN Security Council resolutions, calls for the “disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon,” including Hezbollah. The foreign minister caveated this statement by saying that “as long as we have occupied land, it is not difficult, probably impossible, not to have resistance, and I mean military resistance. So we have got to fix our borders with Israel. We have got to fix them once and for good.” Lebanese political analyst Ronnie Chatah told CNBC, “the occupation the foreign minister is referring to is the Shebaa farms. This disputed, limited zone that Syria considers Lebanese and that Israel considers occupied, or now annexed. Golan Heights, Lebanon, of course, back then, took the Syrian line. This is not a raison d’etre, to have the largest paramilitary force on the planet.” The country has been in political deadlock long before the war began. Lebanon has been without a president since Michel Aoun left the post in 2022, and the current government exists in a caretaker format. Lebanon’s political system is held together by a sectarian power-sharing agreement, guaranteeing the representation of the country’s diverse religious groups, but has often been blamed for contributing to its deadlock. “I’m not claiming that this government has the trust of all Lebanese, but it has the trust of most Lebanese,” Bou Habib told CNBC. The World Bank estimates a total of $8.5 billion in damages to the Lebanese economy, resulting from the conflict which includes physical damage and economic loss. Lebanon’s Economy Minister Amin Salam told CNBC earlier this month the costs could be much greater, and would stand at around $20 billion in accumulated losses to not only the economy, but infrastructure and employment losses. The World Bank also estimates the current conflict could “cut Lebanon’s real GDP growth by at least 6.6% in 2024.” Salam added that the country’s embattled economy could contract by as much as 8% to 12% within the next year. “The funding challenges for rebuilding efforts in Lebanon are immense and urgent,” Mercy Corps Country Director for Lebanon, Laila Al Amine, told CNBC. “The conflict has caused extensive damage to roads, water facilities, schools, hospitals, and power plants, requiring substantial resources, skilled labor, and time for reconstruction. Funding remains a critical hurdle, as much of the pledged humanitarian aid has yet to be disbursed,” Al Amine added. Bou Habib told CNBC: “We are receiving humanitarian help from all Gulf Countries.” “We did not start discussions on further assistance regarding reconstruction and rebuilding of infrastructure in Lebanon, we’ll be doing that soon and we will see what happens,” he added, on further financial aid. Gulf Arab states helped rebuild Lebanon after the 2006 war, but years of economic decline and an emboldened Hezbollah could now deter the global community and specifically the Middle East from helping with Lebanon’s costly reconstruction.",CNBC,Center,816,"Center

This week, the FDA issued recommendations for streamlining the clearance process for AI-powered medical devices. The memo announcing this change recognizes that the utilization of AI in devices “is an iterative process” and aims to make it easier to improve software within the regulatory process. The guidance, which is not legally enforceable but “describe the Agency’s current thinking” suggests that manufacturers could provide a plan for updating AI-powered software in medical devices that would reduce the need to file for a new clearance from the regulatory body. Instead, manufacturers would submit proposed changes to software, a proposal for testing those changes for safety and efficacy and strategies to minimize the risk of updates. The CEO of UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, was fatally shot in Manhattan Wednesday morning, outside of the New York Hilton Midtown, in what police believe was a targeted shooting. UnitedHealth Group was holding a meeting for investors at the New York Hilton Midtown, where the shooting occurred. At the time of this writing, law enforcement is still looking for the alleged attacker, who fled on a bike after shooting Thompson from a few feet away. Read more here.

307,Shares of drone maker Unusual Machines soar after Donald Trump Jr. joins advisory board,"The share price of Unusual Machines closed trading Wednesday nearly 85% higher after the small U.S. drone and drone component maker said that Donald Trump Jr. — the eldest son of President-elect Donald Trump — had joined its advisory board. Unusual Machines shares rose by more than 100% on the heels of that news. The stock closed at $9.89 per share. “Don Jr. joining our board of advisors provides us unique expertise we need as we bring drone component manufacturing back to America,” said Unusual Machines CEO Allan Evans in a statement. “He brings a wealth of experience and I look forward to his advice and role within the Company as we continue to build our business,” said Evans, whose Orlando, Florida-based company has a market capitalization of less than $75 million. Trump Jr., in his own statement, said, “The need for drones is obvious. It is also obvious that we must stop buying Chinese drones and Chinese drone parts.” “I love what Unusual Machines is doing to bring drone manufacturing jobs back to the USA and am excited to take on a bigger role in the movement,” said Trump Jr. In an S-1 filing on Wednesday, Unusual Machines says its consumer business “has been heavily dependent on Chinese imports for our products and operations,” and raises the risks of President-elect Trump imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. “As a result of the recent United States presidential election, President-elect Trump is expected to threaten to and may impose steep tariffs on the importation from China of goods including the drones we use in our B2C business,” the filing said. “If there are increased tariffs imposed, it could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.” The president-elect on Monday said he would slap “an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs” on imports from China unless the nation stemmed the trafficking of chemicals used to make the deadly opioid fentanyl. In the same S-1 statement, Unusual Machines disclosed that Trump Jr. held 331,580 shares of Unusual Machines. Of that, 131,580 shares were held due to his participation in a private placement offering of shares at a purchase price of $1.52 per unit. Trump Jr. holds the remaining 200,000 shares as the result of a restricted stock unit agreement and advisory agreement, the filing says. Half of those shares can be immediately sold when the company’s board approves the agreements, and the rest of those shares will vest on May 22, 2025, according to the S-1. Brian Hoff, the chief financial officer, declined to comment when asked what Trump Jr.’s advisory agreement will require of him. Trump Jr. earlier in November told donors he was joining the venture capital firm 1789 Capital, The New York Times previously reported. Unusual Machines closed its initial public offering of 1.25 million shares of stock for net proceeds of $3.85 million in February. The company recently reported revenues of just $3.56 million for the nine months ending Sept. 30 and a net loss of $4.86 million for the same period. Unusual Machines shares hit a 52-week low of 98 cents per share in May of this year. Volume was heavy Wednesday, topping 46 million shares by late afternoon. The company’s 10-day average trading volume is just 380,000 shares or so. Unusual Machines has just 8.3 million shares outstanding. When the company completed its IPO in February, it also acquired the drone brands Fat Shark and Rotor Riot from Red Cat. Jeffrey Thompson, the founder and CEO of Red Cat, is the founder, prior CEO and current board member of Unusual Machines. Unusual Machines in a recent regulatory filing noted that it changed its accounting firm in April and “terminated its engagement with their prior auditor.” “On May 3, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued an order that instituted a cease-and-desist against the Company’s previous auditor, which required the Company to obtain new auditors and re-audit its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,” the filing noted. That auditor was BF Borgers CPA, which also had been the auditor for Trump Media, the social media company whose majority owner is the president-elect. The SEC in May charged BF Borgers with “massive fraud” for work that affected more than 1,500 SEC filings. The auditor and owner Benjamin Borgers agreed to be permanently suspended from practicing as an accountants before the SEC and to pay a combined $14 million in penalties. Trump Media soon after retained a new auditor to replace BF Borgers. Unusual Machines in its recent quarterly report said that its own new accounting firm re-audited the company’s prior financial statements, and found that “certain transactions were not recorded in the correct period, stock compensation expense of $600,000 related to the March 7, 2023 common stock issuance was not recorded and deferred offering costs were classified as an operating activity rather than a financing activity.” This is developing news.

350,California Governor Newsom Requests $25 Million from Legislature for Anti-Trump Litigation Fund,"California governor Gavin Newsom is calling for lawmakers to approve a $25 million litigation fund to defend the state from federal overreach and “potential harm” during President-elect Donald Trump’s second administration. The Democrat made the request on Monday to kick off a special session aimed at Trump-proofing the progressive state ahead of Trump’s inauguration in January. The proposed $25 million fund would be available to the California Department of Justice and other state agencies to “defend California from unconstitutional federal overreach, challenge illegal federal actions in court, and take administrative actions to reduce potential harm,” according to a press release from Newsom’s office. Newsom vowed to work with the new administration, adding that “we want President Trump to succeed in serving all Americans.” “But when there is overreach, when lives are threatened, when rights and freedoms are targeted, we will take action,” he said in a prepared statement. Newsom’s office said the $25 million would be used to protect billions of dollars in state funding, including disaster relief and health care. It would also be used to protect abortion access, “access to clean air and water, and fundamental civil rights.” During Trump’s first term, California’s spent about $42 million to support 122 lawsuits against his administration, Newsom’s office reported. That money resulted in tens of millions of dollars more in federal reimbursements, billions of dollars in savings for California consumers, and protected billions of dollars in federal funding, the office said. California attorney general Rob Bonta said in a prepared statement that the $25 million litigation fund would ensure this office has “the resources we need to meet the demands of the moment and robustly defend California’s people, progress and values.” “With potentially billions of dollars in federal funding on the line if the President-elect follows through on his promises, we must be — and we are — ready to act on day one,” Bonta said. According to the Sacramento Bee, Newsom told reporters on Monday that it is important for California to “prepare for Trump 2.0, where his rhetoric is not only heightened, but his call for retribution, revenge is pretty clear. Anyone who’s not paying attention, I think is doing so at their own peril.”. State assemblyman James Gallagher, the Republican leader, told the paper that the special session was a “total posture” from Newsom who wants to be a “progressive darling.” “I mean, Gavin Newsom wants to run for president,” he said. “That’s what this is about.” In addition to the $25 million litigation fund requested by Newsom, Democratic state senator Scott Wiener, filed a bill Monday to provide another $25 million for legal services, including for defending illegal immigrants from deportation, and $10 million “to ensure cities & counties can defend against Trump.” Today, as Chair of the Senate Budget Committee, I introduced SB1X 1 in our Special Session. It provides: $25M to Dept of Justice to enforce the law when Trump violates it $25M for legal services, eg deportation defense $10M to ensure cities & counties can defend against Trump — Senator Scott Wiener (@Scott_Wiener) December 2, 2024 Newsom called for the special session just days after Trump won the presidential election, claiming that the “freedoms we hold dear in California are under attack.” As governor, Newsom has turned California into sanctuary for people seeking abortions and transgender surgeries and treatments; mandated that all new vehicles sold in the state be electric, hydrogen-powered or plug-in hybrids by 2035; and expanded state-funded health care to include all low-income residents, including illegal immigrants. Newsom’s request for the litigation fund comes as California faces a deficit of about $2 billion next year, according to a projection from the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. The state’s budget shortfall is projected to reach about $30 billion by fiscal 2028-29, with one analyst telling reporters recently that California has “really no capacity for new commitments.” Send a tip to the news team at NR.",NationalReview,Lean Right,652,"Lean Left

381,The History Lesson Democrats Can’t Afford to Forget,"Well, that was a thumping, wasn’t it? Even optimistic MAGA fans didn’t see Donald Trump winning the popular vote, taking control of the Senate and the House, and sweeping all seven swing states. He came within five points of taking New Jersey! Exit polls showed more than half of Latino men voting for him! The results are devastating for Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Chuck Schumer, and the rest of the Democrats: They lost the nation. So what on earth do they do next? One approach would be to repeat what they’ve been doing. Resist! It’s what they chose the last time Trump won. In the aftermath of Trump’s 2016 victory, America was stunned. There had never been a president so immune to normal analysis, and, as such, so unpredictable. Each time he opened his mouth, Trump exploded political norms—and Democrats responded in kind. Being an opposition party was not enough, they believed. Instead, they would fight his very legitimacy. They built this idea of resistance into their very fabric, and it infected every aspect of progressive society—from raging late-night talk show hosts to left-wing prosecutors determined to put Trump in prison.But while the Democrats won in 2020, the resistance ultimately failed. Democrats spent nearly a decade telling Americans that Trump was an existential threat to the republic. And what happened? Americans from all walks of life voted for him in overwhelming numbers. The Democrats wanted to erase Trump from the political scene; instead he now controls it. Perpetual outrage was not the path to power. Let’s be honest, it was a total disaster: The resistance pulled on pink hats, and hollered about fascism—and then gasped with shock when the nation chose Trump again. Democrats Have Recovered from Worse DefeatsSo the party is in a pickle. If the Democrats want a shot at winning in 2028, then they need a new direction. Losing parties survive by figuring out why they lost and trying something different next time. In the meantime, they take incremental wins when they can. They act like an opposition, not a resistance. The good news for Democrats is that they’ve been here before. Forty years ago, a few centrist renegades mapped out a course that eventually saved the party from oblivion. If you are devastated over last week’s electoral blowout, well, Trump’s victory was a squeaker compared to Ronald Reagan’s landslide over Walter Mondale in 1984. The Democrats were not just in disarray, they were on life support. It’s hard to overstate the scope of that Reagan victory. Mondale, who was vice president during Jimmy Carter’s one-term presidency, lost everywhere except his home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia. Reagan swept up everything else. A conservative Republican won Massachusetts, New York, and Hawaii, for God’s sake. And yet only eight years later, the Democrats found their savior, a young governor from Arkansas named Bill Clinton. Democrats Were Backed by Special Interest Groups, Not VotersMondale’s loyalty to interest groups inside the Democratic party was his Achilles’ heel. Gary Hart, a senator from Colorado and his chief rival in the primary that year, summed up the problem as follows: “You have to reach [those voters] who don’t feel represented by the AFL[AFL-CIO], the NAACP, NOW [National Organization for Women], or the Sierra Club.”But Mondale could not see beyond the demands of the noisiest factions in his coalition. His campaign attacked one of Reagan’s most innovative initiatives—research into space-based missile defense—claiming “killer weapons” would send the arms race with the Soviets spinning out of control.And Reagan countered with one of the most effective ads in American political history. Some people say the bear is tame. Others say it’s vicious and dangerous. Since no one can really be sure who’s right, isn’t it smart to be as strong as the bear?Al From, one of the men who would eventually remake the Democratic Party, watched all this with dismay. In one sense, Mondale was an effective candidate. He unified all the special interest groups in the party. Except for one thing.

53,Austin endorses women in combat jobs and exhorts West Point cadets to defend the Constitution,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin used a speech at West Point Wednesday to forcefully endorse having women in combat roles and emphasize the military’s obligation to defend the U.S. Constitution — ideals some fear may come under fire in the upcoming Trump administration. Speaking to cadets at the U.S. Military Academy in New York, he recalled commanding troops during the early days of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. He said he wanted to keep his command post at the front where he could see the fight, but he told his soldiers that the risks were serious and any of them could stay back and no one would think less of them. It was one of the women, he said, that was first to challenge him on it. “In no uncertain terms, they were telling me to stop talking and get to the fight. And that is who the women of the United States military are,” said Austin. His remarks are in contrast to some made by the man Trump has tapped to be Austin’s successor to lead the Pentagon. Pete Hegseth, a Fox News co-host and former Army National Guard soldier, has made it clear that he believes men and women should not serve together in combat units. A month ago, he told podcast host Shawn Ryan that, “I’m straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn’t made us more effective. Hasn’t made us more lethal. Has made fighting more complicated.” Austin, a retired four-star general who has spent more than 40 years in the Army and commanded at every level, pushed back, saying he’s seen incredibly capable and brave women fighting for their country in battle. “So look, if I get a little fired up about this, it’s just because this isn’t 1950. It isn’t 1948. It is 2024,” said Austin. “And any military that turns away tough, talented patriots — women or men — is just making itself weaker and smaller. So enough already.” While never mentioning President-elect Donald Trump, Hegseth or the incoming administration, Austin also admonished the cadets to remember their sworn duty to defend the Constitution. His remarks echoed others who have warned about the potential for Trump to try and use active-duty military troops to police the southern border, deport immigrants who don’t have legal permanent status, and even on city streets to combat urban crime. And through his campaign, Trump has renewed his pledge to deploy troops within the U.S. when he deems necessary. During his first term, as riots against police brutality roiled the nation, Trump pushed to deploy military personnel on Washington, D.C. street. Top military officers, such as then-Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, resisted those plans, including issuing a memo that stressed that every member of the military “swears an oath to support and defend the Constitution and the values embedded within it.” “We defend government of the people, by the people, and for the people — and we do not bend on matters of honor, integrity, or law,” Austin said at West Point. “We are here to protect our people, to defend our country, and to uphold our Constitution. And that is not negotiable.” ___",APNEWS,Left,542,"Lean Left  
The article presents a perspective that strongly supports women in combat roles and implicitly critiques potential policies of the incoming Trump administration. It highlights values such as constitutional defense and inclusivity within the military, which resonate more with progressive ideologies. The comparison to Trump's views suggests a critical stance towards right-leaning positions, placing the content in the ""Lean Left"" category."
296,Trump picks finance professor Faulkender for deputy Treasury secretary,"WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday nominated University of Maryland finance professor Michael Faulkender as deputy U.S. Treasury secretary, returning him to the department where he helped implement a pandemic relief program that kept paychecks flowing to workers idled by COVID-19. Faulkender served as Treasury's assistant secretary of economic policy, where he advised then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on economic policy issues. If confirmed as deputy secretary, this role would be expanded to a broad range of other areas, including sanctions policy, financial markets regulation, tax policy and the $28 trillion Treasury debt market. Trump earlier this month named prominent investor Scott Bessent as his choice for Treasury secretary, a decision that appeared to calm market concerns about Trump's planned tariffs and tax cuts that could balloon budget deficits. ""Mike is a distinguished Economist and Policy practitioner who will drive our America First Agenda,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. ""He will help Treasury Secretary Nominee Scott Bessent usher in a new Golden Age for the United States by delivering a Great Economic Boom for all Americans."" At the end of the first Trump administration Faulkender returned to the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business, where has been a finance professor since 2008. He also has served as the chief economist for two years at the America First Policy Institute, conservative think tank that has helped shape Trump's policy agenda. Trump has drawn several nominees from the group's ranks. During a hearing of Congress' Joint Economic Committee in March, on the U.S. fiscal situation, Faulkender testified, opens new tab that by January 2021, the U.S. economy was already recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of Trump administration aid programs, including the $800 billion Paycheck Protection Program, which he helped sell to Congress in 2020. The program gave grants to small- and mid-sized companies that allowed them to continue paying employees that could not work during the pandemic. Faulkender said that an additional $2 trillion in COVID-19 aid from the Biden administration approved in 2021 helped fuel inflation and said spending cuts were needed. Debt growth and rising debt services costs ""have the potential to create a bond market failure that would crush our economy and rupture our society,"" he said in prepared testimony, opens new tab. ""To solve this problem, we must greatly reduce spending and deregulate our economy to bring down inflation, thus bringing down the interest rate that must be paid on our outstanding debt.""",Reuters,Center,418,"Lean Right  
The article reflects a Lean Right bias as it primarily focuses on the nomination of a finance professor aligned with the Trump administration's economic policies. It presents Trump's ""America First Agenda"" positively and quotes Faulkender's views that align with conservative economic principles, such as spending cuts and deregulation.

292,How To Make An                AI-Proof Small Business Fortune,"Nick Huber’s first business, Storage Squad, didn’t begin with a slick pitch deck to potential investors or an analysis of the total addressable market, but with a simple Craigslist ad. It was 2011, the summer before his senior year at Cornell University. While some friends were heading to New York City for investment banking internships, Huber was going home to Leopold, Indiana, unsure of what he wanted to do. He figured he’d pick up a few bucks by subletting his Ithaca place through Craigslist. That's when the mother of a fellow student reached out through the site, hoping to store her kid’s belongings in his apartment. Huber ended up creating Storage Squad, a summer service for college kids that picked-up their stuff when school ended, moved it to a storage locker then reversed the process in the fall. Storage Squad ultimately expanded to places like Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. While growing his service business, Huber also started buying storage units, eventually owning a stake in 64 locations spread across 11 states. In 2021 he sold Storage Squad for $1.75 million. He kept the units. While he grew his business, Huber was developing a startup philosophy that has helped him build a mini- business empire–and seems particularly well suited to the age when so many white-collar workers feel threatened by artificial intelligence. “AI will never be able to clean, build and maintain our physical world. The sweatier the job, the better,’’ he declares. The 35-year-old Huber, who now calls Athens, Georgia home, has made millions by not being a Wall Street wizard or coding apps that claim to “change the world.” Instead, he has built or invested in 11 businesses that together, he says, generated more than $50 million in sales last year. None are based in Manhattan or Menlo Park. They don’t retain fancy PR firms or claim to be making earth-shattering breakthroughs. Almost all of them were bootstrapped – and Huber insists that they earn their keep within a matter of months. It’s essentially the opposite of the typical business model of a VC-backed Forbes 30 Under 30 startup. Huber is keen to get rich, but skeptical of the value of immediately going for the big score. He figures his network of storage facilities, which last year had $15 million in revenue, is worth around $140 million based on its $9.8 million in net operating income and the valuation of publicly traded storage companies. (He only owns part of it.) Add in the value of his holdings in other companies, and Forbes estimates Huber is worth about $35 million. On X (formerly Twitter), where he has 385,000 followers, he delights in trolling those who think every startup should disrupt an industry or scale to the sky. Instead, he offers relentlessly down-to-earth advice. “Unless you are already wealthy or live in your parents basement, every single business you start needs to be cash flow positive within 2 months,’’ he wrote recently. “You are in no position to take a moonshot. Go get rich doing something simple, then take the moonshot when you can afford it.” He’s writing a book, tentatively titled The Sweaty Startup, to be published next year by HarperCollins, based on that philosophy. When Huber first heard from that mom looking for summer storage space in 2011, the obvious question was why she wasn’t using one of the established storage companies in Ithaca? Turns out these firms were still sending out workers with clipboards and paper schedules and weighing every box. They were plodding, unwilling to accommodate last minute appointments. “I figured I could just out operate them,” Huber says. He recruited Dan Hagberg, his fellow co-captain of the Cornell track team, and they used their own big old cars—a 1999 Cadillac DeVille and a 1997 Buick LeSabre—for pick-ups. “We worked our butts off for a week and the next thing we know we had $3,000 of cash sitting on a bed and we’re just like ‘wow, we created that out of nothing,’"" he recalls. Senior year, Huber took a course in entrepreneurialism. The prof was dismissive of his moving and storage business because he believed it wasn’t scalable and didn’t have a “moat” –something making it difficult for competitors to imitate. But after learning what a moat was, Huber concluded his real advantage was a willingness to sweat and a drive to deliver first-rate customer service. “I have a theory around trying to change anything,” Huber says. “If you try to change the world, if you try to change people, you’re going to go broke. Look at where people are spending their money now and go get a little bit of that money.” Huber is both a born hustler and a natural grinder. In high school, he was more of a standout athlete than student and ended up at an Ivy League university by having his high school coach cold call college track coaches. He left Ithaca as an Academic All-American, and the holder of school records in the pentathlon, heptathlon, and decathlon. “Nick will do in three days what it takes most people three years to do,’’ says Hagberg, who has been partners with Huber since that first summer moving venture. Huber hasn’t limited himself to dirty businesses. But he thinks that is the best place for most aspiring entrepreneurs to start. Then he believes they should expand to ancillary businesses when they see a need and have capital to deploy. His businesses needed websites, so in 2023 he created WebRun, which builds web pages geared toward turning visitors into clients. Realizing the crucial role of search engine optimization in his storage business led him to establish BoldSEO. As his real estate portfolio expanded, he saw the benefits of cost segregation, which accelerates the tax depreciation schedule of real estate assets to free up more cash. That led to the 2022 creation of RE Cost Seg. The same logic applies to Titan Risk, his commercial insurance broker. “Nick gets an idea in his head and he moves extremely fast,’’ says Mitchell Baldridge, Huber’s long-time CPA and cofounder of RE Cost Seg. In 2021, Huber started hiring workers in the Philippines at $5 an hour to staff his customer support lines around the clock and used an outsourcing startup called Support Shepherd. Impressed, he bought 15% of the company in 2022. This year he raised $30 million, $20 million in equity plus $10 million in debt, to take majority ownership at a $52 million valuation, renamed it Somewhere and brought in an experienced Silicon Valley exec, as CEO. Along with customer support workers, Somewhere recruits–and Huber uses–coders from Latin America and the Philippines. He shrugs off criticisms that he’s exporting U.S. jobs or exploiting foreign workers. Big business outsources all the time, he says. And, of course, now that Huber is buying small businesses, he has started his own business brokerage, this one called simply, Nick Huber. Huber’s approach to finding opportunities is simple but compelling: just look around you, see what services are making money and figure out if you can do them better. Hard work is essential: One of his main tactics is spotting local businesses with poor customer service. How do you find them? He’ll call pretending to be a customer, especially over the weekend. If the phone just keeps ringing, you’ve found a weak spot. But if someone picks up right away, the business is likely stiff competition. Similarly, if a local business is still using a fax machine, that’s another tip off that they’re vulnerable. As it expanded, Storage Squad picked its targets through common sense and a little experience, not big marketing studies. “We figured out quickly that the private expensive schools with a lot of out-of-state students were our wheelhouse,” says Huber. “A state school in the south, like the University of Georgia, the kids are resourceful, they drive trucks, they go rent storage units.” The same can’t be said for Boston where “they’ve got dad’s Amex and they’re ready to solve the problem with a couple hundred bucks.”",Forbes,Center,1340,"Center

329,Migrant Caravan Racing toward U.S. Border to Arrive ahead of Trump’s Inauguration,"A caravan of about 1,500 migrants left southern Mexico on Sunday night en route to the United States in hopes of getting across the border and into the country before President-elect Donald Trump takes office again next month. But the caravan’s start comes as Mexican leaders continue their crackdown on immigrants traveling to the U.S. Two other caravans that started heading north from southern Mexico last month were recently broken up by Mexican authorities, according to news reports. The effort to break up the two caravans appeared to be part of “an agreement between the president of Mexico and the president of the United States,” migrant rights activist Luis Garcia Villagrán told the Associated Press last week. The latest caravan — mostly migrants from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, Colombia, Guatemala, and Honduras — began traveling at night to avoid the daytime heat. They hope to reach the U.S. to “achieve a better life for their families,” a migrant from Honduras told the AP. Some migrants expressed concern that Trump will end the CBP One cellphone app that President Joe Biden launched in January 2023. The app allows 1,450 immigrants per day to schedule asylum-claim interviews via smartphones. “There are a lot of reports that he has said he is going to do away with CBP One, that there are going to be deportations, the biggest deportations,” Venezuelan migrant Francisco Unda told the AP, “but you have to have faith in God.” Illegal border crossings have dropped sharply this year after years of record highs, in part because the Biden administration has funneled border crossers to official ports of entry where they’ve increasingly been paroled into the country with a quasi-legal status. The Mexican government has also helped to curb the flow of migrants to the U.S. border by rounding up prospective border-crossers and keeping them in southern Mexican states along the Guatemala border. Todd Bensman, a national-security fellow with the Center for Immigration Studies, recently claimed that Tapachula, a city in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, “holds a migrant time bomb ready to go off.” “People are tired of being in Tapachula,” a migrant from El Salvador told the Spanish news agency, EFE. “There is no work, no accommodation, no money, and people have been waiting for four to five months and can’t find anything in this city.” Last month, Trump announced plans to impose 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods until they cooperate with his plans to curtail illegal immigration and combat fentanyl trafficking. Mexico’s leftist president, Claudia Sheinbaum, initially responded by floating a threat of retaliatory tariffs: “To one tariff will come another and so on, until we put our common businesses at risk.” But in late November, Trump announced that he had a “very productive conversation” with Sheinbaum, writing on Truth Social that she “has agreed to stop Migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border.” Sheinbaum also wrote on X she’d had an “excellent conversation” with Trump. “We discussed Mexico’s strategy on the migration phenomenon, and I shared that caravans are not arriving at the northern border because they are being taken care of in Mexico,” she wrote. Regarding the two caravans that Mexican authorities broke up last month, the first departed from Tapachula on November 5, the day Trump was elected, according to the AP. That caravan of about 2,500 to 3,000 people traveled about 270 miles. “After hearing that Trump had won, many of those in the caravan felt less hopeful about their chance at a new life in the United States,” Reuters reported in early November. “I had hoped [Kamala Harris] would win,” a Venezuelan migrant told the news agency. The second caravan of about 1,500 migrants started traveling north on November 20, and traveled about 140 miles before it was broken up, the AP reported.

3,European Union orders TikTok to preserve data related to Romanian election,"LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators ordered TikTok on Thursday to retain any information related to Romania’s presidential election, after the country’s top defense body released declassified intelligence alleging that Moscow arranged an online campaign to support a candidate who emerged as a surprise front-runner. LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators ordered TikTok on Thursday to retain any information related to Romania’s presidential election, after the country’s top defense body released declassified intelligence alleging that Moscow arranged an online campaign to support a candidate who emerged as a surprise front-runner. As controversy swirls around the election, the 27-nation bloc’s executive arm is using its sweeping digital rulebook to step up scrutiny of the role played by the video sharing platform. Far-right populist Calin Georgescu emerged from obscurity to top the polls in the first round of the Romanian presidential vote on Nov. 24, plunging the European Union and NATO country into turmoil. In an unprecedented move, President Klaus Iohannis ordered the release on Wednesday of the intelligence files that allege a sprawling network of thousands of social media accounts across platforms like TikTok and Telegram promoted Georgescu content. The European Commission said it issued TikTok with a “retention order” demanding that it “freeze and preserve data” related to so-called systemic risks that the video-sharing platform’s service could pose to “electoral processes and civic discourse” in the EU. The order also applies to any national election in the EU until March 31. TikTok has “already been cooperating with the Commission and will continue to do so,” the company said in a statement. “We look forward to establishing the facts in light of some of the speculation and inaccurate reports we have seen.” The commission said TikTok must hang on to internal documents and information about the design and function of its systems that recommend content to users. It also has to preserve files on how it addresses the risk that fake accounts are used in a coordinated way to manipulate users. Officials told a daily briefing in Brussels that the commission had received the Romanian intelligence files. “I can confirm that we have received and we are currently working on these documents now,” commission spokesman Thomas Regnier said. Henna Virkkunen, the commission’s executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said in a statement that, “This preservation order is a key step in helping investigators establish the facts and adds to our formal requests for information, which seek information following the declassification of secret documents yesterday.” The commission is using the Digital Services Act to scrutinize TikTok, which many observers say played a big role in Georgescu’s success in the first-round vote. The DSA is a wide-ranging set of regulations that took effect last year aimed at cleaning up big online platforms and protecting internet users, under threat of hefty fines. “We have a tool at our disposal where we make sure that the very large online platforms have their role to play and make sure that their services are not misused to influence voters and to influence people,” Regnier said. Officials in Brussels said they’re not calling Romania’s electoral processes into question but are monitoring TikTok’s compliance with EU rules, though they have “no position” on whether the company has infringed them. On Sunday, Georgescu will face pro-EU reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party in a final vote. In releasing the declassified files, intelligence authorities said information they obtained “revealed an aggressive promotion campaign” to increase and accelerate Georgescu’s popularity. According to the files, the Romanian secret services alleged one TikTok user paid $381,000 to other users to promote Georgescu content. The Commission has already asked TikTok twice for information on its recommendation systems related to elections, including a second request on Friday for additional information on how it manages risks from “information manipulation.” Earlier this week, during questioning from a committee of European Parliament lawmakers, TikTok executives said they uncovered several Romanian influence networks including one that supported Georgescu but defended the platform’s election integrity practices.

190,Trump taps Paul Atkins to lead the SEC in crypto-friendly move,"President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins for chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins was an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush and is a well-known figure in Washington's conservative financial world. He's also an outspoken supporter of the crypto industry and cochairs the Chamber of Digital Commerce's Token Alliance, an industry-led initiative to represent the sector. If confirmed, Atkins will replace Gary Gensler, who has drawn the ire of much of the crypto community and plans to step down as chair on January 20. ""Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post announcing the pick. He added that Atkins ""recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before."" Atkin's nomination puts Trump a step closer to fulfilling his promise to create a more crypto-friendly regulatory regime. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to fire Gensler, who crypto players have criticized for stifling innovation and creating uncertainty with his approach to regulating the industry. Bitcoin and ethereum both rose on the news and were up 3.3% and 7.7%, respectively, around 3:40 p.m. ET. Bitcoin is once again testing the key $100,000 threshold that it nearly cleared last week before reversing course. During his tenure, Gensler led the SEC on a crackdown on crypto issuers for dealing in what the agency said were unregistered securities. Industry insiders soured on his stance, blaming Gensler for pushing crypto business out of the US. Following last month's news that Gensler would resign when Trump takes office, crypto token XRP rallied sharply to become the third largest coin by market capitalization. The token had languished in recent years as the SEC targeted issuer Ripple Labs for violating securities law. The market expects the agency to drop that lawsuit and many other crypto suits under Trump.",BusinessInsider,Lean Left,308,"Lean Right  
The article showcases a positive portrayal of Donald Trump's nomination of Paul Atkins to the SEC, highlighting Atkins' alignment with pro-crypto views and his endorsement by Trump. This reflects a favorable stance toward conservative economic policies and the crypto industry, which tends to align with right-leaning perspectives. Additionally, it critiques the previous SEC chair, Gary Gensler, and underscores a shift towards more supportive regulatory approaches under Trump's administration, further reinforcing a lean towards right-leaning media bias."
335,"As Trump lines up his sights on EV mandates and tax credits, automakers scramble to find new paths","The Biden-Harris administration ushered in a deluge of rules limiting emissions in the transportation sector, and the only way for automakers to comply would be to produce a lot of electric vehicles. The “Big Three” American automakers hopped on board the administration’s mandates and plowed full steam ahead on setting targets to produce ever increasing amounts of electric vehicles. The American consumer, however, was less enthusiastic about the plan, and the companies have lost considerable money trying to transition to EVs. Now those automaker investments are all more vulnerable. Incoming GOP President Trump was vocal during his campaign that he would be no friend of the Biden-Harris EV rules, and they are not likely to survive long after Jan. 20, when Trump takes office. Trump has also voiced opposition to the EV tax credits. And though squashing them would require an act of Congress because they are part of the Inflation Reduction Act, that may still happen. Conflicting reports Signals from the auto industry have been mixed. Citing unnamed “lobbyists and officials from several car companies,” The New York Times reported last month that car companies wanted to keep the mandates. The Times also pointed to a letter from John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents the manufacturers of almost all new vehicles sold in the U.S. The letter argued that automakers’ success depends on “stability and predictability in auto-related emissions standards.” The Washington Free Beacon challenged the Times’ claims. A spokesperson for Stellantis told the news outlet that contrary to the Times the company had no plans to lobby the incoming administration to maintain the EV mandates, and its lobbyists weren’t among those cited in the Times story. The Beacon also reported that Bozzella’s letter criticized federal and state regulations, arguing they are “out of step with current auto market realities and increase costs for consumers.” Further disputing the Times report was an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on Nov. 24 by Jack Hollis, chief operating officer of Toyota Motor North America. “Artificial mandates and subsidies aren’t working,"" he wrote. ""We believe the incoming administration should replace EV mandates and subsidies with policies that promote consumer choice while contributing to emissions reductions. A consumer-driven market will bring more stability and healthy competition to the auto industry, steady employment for workers and dealers, and more options for American families."" Bailout mentality Executives at Ford and General Motors told The Detroit News they are confident they can navigate any changes to regulations and tax credits in the new administration. Jim Lawler, Ford’s chief financial officer and vice chairman, said the company provides choices in gas-powered, EVs, and hybrids, so it can “pivot” to other lines of business as needed. GM Chief Financial Office Paul Jacobson said the company will work with the incoming administration “on the best path forward while focusing on cutting costs.” Michael Buschbacher, partner at the law firm Boyden Gray PLLC, told Just the News that the automakers stuck to EVs despite the losses because they look at it like a startup. Those tend to lose money for many years before seeing any profits. The automakers bet that “electric vehicles are going to be the standard in the future, and so the company that can get there first with developing the tech and manufacturing capacity is going to be able to expand its market share. I think that's how Ford thinks about it, and is willing to take these losses. But I think that the confidence that electric vehicles would be a good replacement was misplaced,” he said. Buschbacher has represented individuals, companies and organizations with a focus on energy and environmental matters. He said he wasn’t speaking for anyone he’s representing, and only offering his personal perspective on how changes to EV regulations might play out with automakers. Alex Stevens, manager of policy and communications for the Institute for Energy Research, told Just the News that with the federal bailout of Chrysler in 1980 and the 2008 bailouts of the Big Three, the American automobile industry became wedded to the federal government. “They can't ever be on the opposite side of any administration. Because the way that they operate is, implicitly, with a sort of bailout mentality,” he said. Leading up the election, Stevens said, they were positioning themselves to go either way depending on the outcome. Now with Trump coming into the White House, they’re trying to cozy up to the new administration. “Maybe they’re not entirely on board with Trump’s policy agenda, but they’re not in a position to push back against it. They have no bargaining power,” he said. Stevens also speculates that there may be more internal disagreements over the EV vision at the companies than comes out in the media. The abrupt resignation this week of Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares suggests, at least at one of the Big Three, that is the case. Future of less Buschbacher said that the automakers could find some benefits with the coming regulatory changes. While Trump’s rollback of EV mandates will hurt their investments, his trade policy will expand overseas markets and check the rising competitive power of China, which is now the largest automotive exporter in the world. “The consequences of them having made a bad deal may mean that they have a little bit of a tough time adjusting to a America-first, pro-consumer, pro-American worker transportation policy. But that's their own problem, and I think President Trump's response to them is going to be something along the lines of, ‘You made a bad deal, but don't worry. I'm going to make a much better one for you,” Buschbacher said. California was the first state to adopt EV mandates in the form of banning the sale of gas-powered cars. By 2035, all new passenger cars, trucks, and SUVs sold in California will be zero-emission vehicles. California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is vowing that should Trump get the EV tax credit nullified, he’ll make his state’s taxpayers cover it. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has expressed support for ending the tax credit, and Newsom’s tax credit will exclude Tesla. Buschbacher said that the overall goal of the EV mandates wasn’t ultimately to get drivers to switch from one kind of car to another. As only wealthier Americans could afford the cars, which have limited ranges and inadequate charging infrastructure, the EV mandates would likely mean less travel. “So if you're poor, you have to ride the bus or take a little Lime scooter or just stay at home. Because fundamentally, a lot of the climate policy that has been in the Biden-Harris administration, and in California, is de-growth in its outlook. It sees the solution to climate change not being new technology, but in just a future of less. And I think the automakers didn't fully appreciate how the regulations were actually going to be written to do that, to have a future of less, rather than just to encourage the transition,” Buschbacher said.",JustTheNews,Lean Right,1162,"Lean Right  
The article discusses the implications of upcoming policy changes under the Trump administration regarding electric vehicle (EV) mandates and tax credits, portraying concerns from automakers while referencing criticism of regulations. It highlights views from industry leaders and commentators who favor reduced regulations, indicating a preference for a less interventionist government approach.

293,Bubble bath on duty: Ernst report details federal employees’ abuse of remote work,"Perhaps nothing sums up remote work better than this selfie of a federal employee jumping on a call in a bubble bath. The employee was a manager at the Department of Veterans affairs who posted the picture on social media with the caption – my office for the next hour. The picture encapsulates a new report from Senator Joni Ernst which found just 6% of federal employees work in the office full time, while about one-third are fully remote. Ernst’s investigation discovered the remote work has resulted in American taxpayers receiving inadequate services including service backlogs and delays, unanswered phone calls and emails, and no-show appointments. The shortcomings include calls from veterans from mental health services going unanswered. Ernst also said remote work partially contributed to the infant formula shortage of 2022. A whistleblower informed the Food and Drug Administration about unsanitary conditions at the formula plant in October 2021, but partially due to remote work, the FDA’s senior leadership was not informed for more than 100 days. The FDA’s reduction of food facility inspections during the pandemic was also a factor. The empty offices are costing taxpayers money. There isn’t a single agency headquarters in Washington that is half full, the average occupancy is 12%. The report states – the government also owns 7,697 vacant buildings and another 2,265 that are partially empty. Maintenance, leases and energy on these buildings costs more than $15 billion a year. Ernst suggests monitoring employees locations and the productivity using VPNs, having use it or lose it policy for government real estate and making remote work policies performance based. Ernst’s report states – “If bureaucrats don’t want to return to work, make their wish come true.” Some of these changes could be implemented through the new Department of Government Efficiency. Ernst heads the DOGE Caucus which will work with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to reduce government waste. Republicans met with the duo on Capitol Hill Thursday afternoon. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-LA: “The taxpayers deserve better. They deserve a more responsive government, a more efficient government, one that is leaner, more focused on its primary objectives. “ Making cuts to the government will need to be a closely aligned effort between the department and Congress, because only lawmakers on Capitol Hill have the power to make budget cuts.",SAN,Center,386,"Lean Right  
This article primarily critiques remote work among federal employees, aligning with Republican sentiments regarding government inefficiency and waste. The emphasis on Senator Joni Ernst's report and quotes from Republican leaders suggests a perspective that favors accountability and oversight in government operations, typical of Lean Right media.

35,Biden library reportedly under threat by Democrats enraged by Hunter pardon,"Senior Democrats are reportedly considering withholding contributions to Joe Biden’s future presidential library amid a mounting backlash over his decision grant a blanket pardon to his son Hunter. The threat has emerged as simmering anger among congressional Democrats – already building over the president’s insistence on seeking a second term before belatedly stepping aside as the party nominee in favour of Kamala Harris – has burst into the open over Sunday’s pardon, which Biden had previously vowed not to give. Axios reported that party grandees were considering taking out their “rage” on Biden’s library project. Planning for the library, in the president’s home state of Delaware, is being spearheaded by the White House deputy chief of staff, Annie Tomasini, and Anthony Bernal, senior adviser to Jill Biden, the first lady. “If they had their shit together, they would have been doing the work on this over the summer – right after he announced he was stepping aside,” the site quoted one unnamed Democrat as saying. “Now, it’s just too late. Hopefully they are rightsizing their expectations and budget!” Presidential libraries – a tradition begun by Franklin D Roosevelt – are generally funded by a combination of private donors, state and local governments, and university partners. Maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration, they are used to house presidents’ papers and documents after they leave office. A source familiar with Biden’s project played down the possibility of donations being withheld, telling Axios: “That sentiment hasn’t come up in a single donor conversation, and work is well under way.” However, the fact that it is being publicly mooted is a sign of the internal party disenchantment following the pardoning of Hunter Biden, 54, who was convicted of lying on gun ownership application forms and separate charges of tax evasion. He had been due to be sentenced on both convictions this month. The act of clemency came less than a month after a demoralising election defeat that many privately blame Biden for. Biden, in his statement, said his son “was treated differently” than other people who had been late paying taxes because they were undergoing addiction problems. Biden pardoned his son for all possible offences committed between 2013 and 2024 – foreclosing the possibility of the incoming Trump administration reopening a case against the younger Biden that might be driven by the president-elect’s often-repeated desire for “retribution” against his political enemies. The judge in the tax case, Mark Scarsi, accused the president of “rewriting history” in a ruling penned after the pardon. He added that Hunter Biden’s tax offences had been committed after the period of his drug and alcohol addiction. A procession of Democratic senators and congressmembers have publicly accused Biden of putting his feelings for his son above the national interest and handing Donald Trump an excuse to abuse the presidential clemency powers. Even Chuck Schumer, the Democrats’ leader in the Senate and normally a loyal ally of the president, damned him with uncharacteristic reticence this week, telling reporters “I’ve got nothing for you on that” when asked his view. But party insiders say the outrage is a lightning rod for lingering resentment over Biden’s refusal to drop his bid for a second term until it was too late for Harris or other presidential contenders to be stress-tested in primaries and launch a well-prepared presidential campaign. “The pardon is simply a resentment delivery vehicle, like dressing on lettuce,” Philippe Reines, a veteran strategist who helped prepare Harris for September’s debate against Trump – which she was widely viewed to have won – told the New York Times. David Axelrod, a former adviser to Barack Obama, said the pardon gave “a free throw for people who think they can gain political advantage” from separating themselves from an unpopular, outgoing president. “But,” he added, “there’s also genuine concern and anger about the way the last year went down.”",TheGuardiadn,Left,646,"Lean Left

355,Families of Israeli Hostages Plead with Trump to ‘Bring Them Back Home’,"Seven families of Israeli hostages are pleading with Donald Trump to demand the return of their relatives that Hamas has imprisoned in Gaza for over a year. “Impose the simple and straight logic to bring them back home and turn their darkness into light and freedom,” they wrote in a letter to the president-elect on Tuesday. The signatories specifically ask Trump to call Qatar’s Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and “demand an end to these games,” referring to the stalled hostage deals that have yet to free some 100 captives remaining in Gaza. “We need a simple American deal with Hamas left in its shadow: Hamas must immediately announce the release of all the living and dead hostages without any conditions and surrender, or all Hamas leaders be immediately deported from the country and will no longer be safe anywhere in the world,” the families said. “This is how the war with a terrorist organization in Gaza should end. This is how your term in the White House should begin. It should be with the rehabilitation of Gaza by Qatar and the Gulf states alongside ensuring the security of the citizens of Israel and the return of our loved one’s home.” The letter’s release came one day after Trump warned there will be “hell to pay” if Hamas doesn’t release the rest of the hostages by Inauguration Day next month. During his 2024 campaign, the former and future president vowed to end the conflict in Gaza that has grown to involve Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel waged the war against Hamas after the Palestinian terror group massacred nearly 2,000 people and abducted over 250 individuals, including seven Americans. Israeli-U.S. soldier Omer Neutra was one of the latest fatalities confirmed by the Israeli military. Hamas terrorists killed Neutra during the October 7 attack last year and have kept his body ever since. Meanwhile, Edan Alexander is believed to be alive after Hamas released a propaganda video showing him addressing coerced messages to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump. In September, the Israeli military recovered the bodies of six hostages, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who were executed by Hamas in a Gaza tunnel shortly before Israeli troops arrived. Those who signed Tuesday’s letter are Hoshea Haggai, brother of Gadi Haggai and brother-in-law of Judih Weinstein Haggai; Doris Liber, mother of Guy Iluz; Ziv Abud, spouse of Eliya Cohen; Talia and Liran Berman, mother and brother of twins Ziv and Gail Berman; Simona and Dor Steinbrecher, mother and brother of Doron Steinbrecher; Amanda Damari, mother of Emily Damari; and Lishay Lavi, wife of Omri Miran. Of the nine hostages listed, six are believed to still be alive and three were murdered in captivity. Liber expressed her grief in an interview with National Review last November when she visited Capitol Hill to plead for the release of her son and only child. At the time, she didn’t know if he was alive. Iluz’s death was announced December 1, 2023. “Symbolically, this year Christmas and the first day of Hanukkah fall on the same day,” the letter addressed to Trump states. “We look forward to the miracle of Christmas and the miracle of Hanukkah for us and implore you to ensure we see light for our loved ones.” Liran Berman said he has the “utmost respect” for the Biden administration, considering the U.S. helped negotiate the breakthrough hostage deal in November 2023. That said, Berman is more optimistic about what a second Trump administration could do to free the hostages. He only gives one caveat for the incoming president. “We just ask him, beg him, demand him to do a deal before he enters office on the 20th of January, before Christmas even,” Berman told NR. “We need them back home as soon as possible. They don’t have time until he’s in office.

73,Billionaire who performed the first private spacewalk is Trump’s pick to lead NASA,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A tech billionaire who bought a series of spaceflights from Elon Musk’s SpaceX and conducted the first private spacewalk was nominated by President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday to lead NASA. Jared Isaacman, 41, CEO and founder of a credit card-processing company, has been a close collaborator with Musk ever since buying his first chartered flight with SpaceX. He took along contest winners on that 2021 trip and followed it in September with a flight where he briefly popped out the hatch to test SpaceX’s new spacewalking suits. If confirmed, Isaacman will replace Bill Nelson, 82, a former Democratic senator from Florida who was nominated by President Joe Biden. Nelson flew aboard space shuttle Columbia in 1986 – on the flight right before the Challenger disaster — while a congressman. Isaacman said he was honored to be nominated and would be “grateful to serve.” “Having been fortunate to see our amazing planet from space, I am passionate about America leading the most incredible adventure in human history,” he said via X. During Nelson’s tenure, NASA picked up steam in its effort to return astronauts to the moon. This next-generation Apollo program — named after Apollo’s mythological twin sister Artemis — plans to send four astronauts around the moon as soon as next year. The first moon landing in more than half a century would follow. NASA is counting on SpaceX to get astronauts to the lunar surface via Starship, the mega rocket launching out of Texas on test flights. The space agency already relies on SpaceX to fly astronauts to and from the International Space Station along with supply runs. Boeing launched its first crew for NASA in June, but the Starliner capsule encountered so many problems that the two test pilots ended up stuck at the space station. They’ll catch a ride home with SpaceX in February, after more than eight months in orbit. Their mission should have lasted eight days. Also on NASA’s plate right now: exploring the solar system. Robotic missions to the moon and beyond continues with a NASA spacecraft en route to Jupiter’s watery moon Europa and the Mars rover Perseverance collecting more rock and dirt samples. Facing tight budgets, NASA is seeking a quicker, cheaper way of getting these Martian samples to Earth than the original plan, which had swollen to $11 billion with nothing arriving before 2040. As with human spaceflight, NASA has turned to industry and others for ideas and help. Musk congratulated Isaacman via X, describing him as a man of “high ability and integrity.” The fighter jet-piloting Isaacman, whose call name is Rook, short for rookie, has described himself as a “space geek” since kindergarten. He dropped out of high school when he was 16, got a GED certificate and started a business in his parents’ basement that became the genesis for Shift4. His business is based in eastern Pennsylvania, where he lives with his wife and their two young daughters. He set a speed record flying around the world in 2009 while raising money for the Make-A-Wish program, and later established Draken International, the world’s largest private fleet of fighter jets. Isaacman has reserved two more flights with SpaceX, including a trip leading Starship’s first crew into orbit around Earth.

194,Donald Trump’s Nomination of Pete Hegseth Is on Shaky Ground,"This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. First came the raw shock of the nomination. A weekend host of a Fox News morning show to lead the Department of Defense, the largest employer in the United States? Really? Then came a reminder that Pete Hegseth doesn’t think women should be in combat roles. And then a nudge to recall that the former National Guardsman thinks diversity and inclusion programs at the Pentagon spawn “wokeness” in the ranks. Then there were the stories about his past advocacy for people accused of war crimes despite opposition from those leading the Department of Defense at the time. And then the stories about his unit’s alleged involvement with war crimes. And his anti-Muslim rhetoric. And maybe a white-Christian-nationalism tattoo. And a flag based on that tattoo to his higher-ups in the military that he could be an “insider threat” who shouldn’t be let near high-pressure environments. Fine, said the crew down at Mar-a-Lago, the de facto White House-in-waiting. Republicans close to the incoming Donald Trump Administration say the team heading back to Washington knew all of this before they nominated Hegseth as their pick to become the next Secretary of Defense and sixth in line for the presidency itself. Republicans in the Senate held steady, even if behind closed doors there was a sinking feeling that they were on a familiar rollercoaster. But what caught the Trump team by surprise were the stories that came next. Hegseth is alleged to have sexually assaulted a woman at a Republican women’s conference in California. There is a police report. And there is a hush-money settlement. (Hegseth has denied the assault allegations, arguing the encounter was consensual, and noting the police did not charge him. He also has stood by both his political stances and the tattoo, which Hegseth said disqualified him from guarding President Joe Biden’s Inauguration despite being “just a Christian symbol.”) Each story came out in recent days before reports surfaced that his own mother sent him a poison-pen email accusing him of being a serial abuser of women and something of a cad. And then there was the one about him as a bad steward of money raised by the powerful Koch network, a sexist bully, and a drunkard on the job who got canned. And the one that said he billed his wife’s credit card for hotel hookup venues. And the one that claimed his former Fox colleagues worried about his alcohol consumption. All of which would probably block any other incoming administration’s pick for a receptionist—let alone a Secretary of Defense—from creeping forward. But this is Trump, and he likes to provoke. His top aides doubled-down on Tuesday despite some grumbling that this mightn’t be the best use of their political capital. But here’s the thing about Trump: he’s loyal until he isn’t. Late Tuesday afternoon, it became clear the nomination was going wobbly in a big way. Hegseth can afford to lose three Republican Senators, and it looks like there may be a few more doubters than that. While plenty of lawmakers have taken the pro-Trump line, some like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina are signaling a “difficult” path ahead. Sen. Joni Ernst, a retired Army Reservist from Iowa who serves on the Armed Services Committee, says she plans a “frank” conversation with Hegseth. The Chairman of that committee, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, said Hegseth will have to answer questions from his panel if he is going to weather the drip of negative stories. Some Republicans who have been inconsistent allies to Trump could break the nomination; many are watching Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Others are bracing for a whistleblower report and audit from Hegseth’s time running the Koch-backed veterans’ group. Privately, Hill staffers are watching the nomination closely and with little certainty. Even as Trump’s team projected confidence, GOP leadership aides are increasingly skeptical. At least a half-dozen Republican Senators are seen as in play, according to three Hill aides. This wouldn’t be Trump’s first Cabinet pick to go down. Trump really liked the idea of former Rep. Matt Gaetz to run the Department of Justice until it became clear he was going to be too much of a headache. The drip of bad news about Gaetz’s alleged sexual encounters with minors, drug use, and more—plus its dominance in the new cycle—proved too much for the President-elect. Trump can stand by someone as long as it doesn’t make him appear foolish; bad news is fine as long as it’s not new news to Number One. Crowding Trump off the front page is a fireable offense. Gaetz’s downfall was the quickest exit of a Cabinet nomination in history so close to Election Day, rivaling a similar eight-day window that George W. Bush’s pick at Labor saw in 2000. So far, Republicans who will control the confirmation—or not—of Trump’s Cabinet picks have largely held the line on Hegseth in a way they did not for Gaetz. But there are sufficient grumblings about moving forward with someone who has never before run something even comparable to the Pentagon to put the nomination in doubt. Senate Republicans fear Trump and his followers, but they also have to take a close eye on the person that will have Trump’s ear on major military action. There is a fine line between messy and untenable; Trump is testing it with Hegseth. Democrats have, to this point, stepped aside and allowed Republicans to make trouble themselves. A favorite gif on the Hill since the nominations started has been some variation of someone watching with fascination as they toss popcorn in their mouths. Although Democrats won’t have a veto over Trump’s picks, they’re also not certain that they’re all going to get through. The chaos has already claimed Gaetz, and it, might soon be a fate shared by Hegseth or even Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s pick as the nation’s top spy master. Another pick raising eyebrows is Kash Patel, a former Hill hand who rose to become the Pentagon’s top aide during the first Trump term and is on deck to head the FBI. And of course there’s anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination to head the Department of Health and Human Services. For now, Trump’s team is telling allies to hold steady on the rest of the slate. Hegseth is on his version of a charm offensive with Hill offices, and many of the Republicans up there are signaling their fealty. “My position is what President Trump decides to do is what I will support,” Sen. Mike Crapo said when asked about the nominees going forward without so much as an FBI background check. (Since Crapo, an Idaho Republican, said this, the Trump campaign announced it would work with the feds on such vetting.) And it’s worth remembering that for every moment of suspense when someone like Collins or Murkowski seems to balk at one of Trump’s moves, they were still more likely to side with Trump than not. Yet despite Trump’s strong support among the Senate’s rank and file, Hegseth still might be in trouble. Tuesday’s latest—that Hegseth billed hotels to his then-wife’s credit card while carrying out five affairs—further loosens his hold on the nomination. Trump loves to throw a surprise at his audience. He doesn’t like it the other way. Which may explain why some of his allies at the Capitol are not really investing their time preparing for Hegseth’s potential nomination hearing. Given just how messy the announced pick has been so far, that could be a waste of time. Washington is just watching for Trump to tire of this and move on to a different pick.

WEX Wakeup: MAHA, Election enthusiasm, Walz helped Wuhan partnered facility UnmuteLoading Ad 00:00/02:44 LIVE A California raw milk producer has been tapped by President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet to advise the Food and Drug Administration. Mark McAfee, CEO of the Fresno-based company Raw Farm, confirmed to the Washington Examiner that he has complied with the request from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, to advise the FDA on the Raw Milk Standards and Policy for Human Consumption panel. McAfee said he has since spoken with the transition team several times, but no final decisions have been made. Raw milk, which has not undergone the heat treatment process of pasteurization to kill harmful bacteria, is a top concern in Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” agenda, partly because of its hotly debated health benefits and risks for spreading disease. Pasteurization has been mandatory in the United States since 1924 to eliminate dangerous bacteria such as E. coli, campylobacter, and salmonella. According to the FDA, milk was responsible for 25% of all illnesses caused by food and water contamination in 1938. However, advocates of raw milk suggest the close relationships between industrialized food producers and the FDA suppress the medical benefits of raw milk, such as decreasing allergies, asthma, eczema, and respiratory infections. In a previous interview, McAfee said he believes the pasteurization process disincentivizes milk producers from maintaining clean conditions in their production facilities. If milk producers were paid more, he said, they would not need pasteurization to kill harmful bacteria. “They’re being paid so little for their milk that the standards under the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance and FDA allow anything to get in because it’s going to get pasteurized,” McAfee told the Washington Examiner in May of industrialized farms. McAfee has over 25 years of experience producing raw milk in California after he took over his family farm in 1990. He also confirmed to the Washington Examiner that Kennedy is “definitely a customer” of his in Los Angeles, where it is legal to sell raw milk in grocery stores but not transport products across state lines. Transportation of raw milk across state lines is strictly prohibited, but it is allowed to be sold in grocery stores in 12 states. Direct farm-to-customer sales are allowed in 20 states. “With RFK being appointed to head the HHS (over the NIH, CDC and FDA), it is certain that decades old FDA anti-raw-milk policies will shift soon,” McAfee said in a Saturday press statement. “Raw Farm is the largest producer of raw milk in the world and stands at the battlefront of this transitional event.” Kennedy has long advocated decoupling corporate interests from the public health sector in food consumption and pharmaceuticals. Although he was associated with the liberal left for many years, he has brought his brand of skepticism of the public health establishment to the fore of the GOP agenda. McAfee told the Washington Examiner that Kennedy “wants all Americans to have that same choice in access to legal safe, tested high-quality raw milk.” However, recently, McAfee has been involved in at least 11 lawsuits related to a salmonella outbreak that sickened at least 171 people between October 2023 and May 2024. Raw Farm has also been the subject of much scrutiny from California public health officials in the context of the H5N1, or bird flu, outbreak among dairy cattle. Particles of the virus have been found in raw milk and have been deemed unsafe for human consumption, as fears of bird flu mutating to more easily infect humans continue to loom. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER McAfee has highlighted that, so far, there have been no reported human infections of bird flu related to the consumption of raw milk containing the H5N1 virus. He also said all Raw Farm cows “are asymptomatic and show no signs” of infection. “Raw Farm has a brain trust of the world’s best H5N1 scientists on our team,” McAfee said in the press release.",WashingtonExaminer,Lean Right,905,"Lean Right  
The article features a focus on RFK Jr.'s controversial stance and highlights the viewpoints of raw milk advocates, presenting a more favorable view of alternative perspectives on public health, which tends to appeal to Right-leaning audiences.

273,US House to consider next steps on Gaetz ethics report,"WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to consider on Thursday what to do with a report on alleged sexual misconduct and drug use by ex-congressman Matt Gaetz, who has dropped his bid to become President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general. A pair of Gaetz-related meetings are planned. The House Ethics Committee, which had probed the allegations, is expected to meet to discuss what to do with the findings of its investigation of Gaetz, according to a source with knowledge of the panel's plans, who was granted anonymity to discuss its inner workings. Thursday is also the deadline for the full Republican-controlled House to consider a motion to force the panel to release its report on Gaetz, 42, who resigned from Congress in November hours after Trump tapped him as a potential attorney general. Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing. Democratic Representative Sean Casten, who is leading the procedural maneuver, opens new tab to allow other House members to vote on whether to publicly release the Gaetz report, cited at least four examples since 1987 of the ethics panel continuing its work and releasing investigative findings after a representative resigns from Congress. The House could vote on the proposal itself -- which would require Republican support to pass -- or simply vote to quash it. The Ethics Committee -- made up of five Republicans and five Democrats -- is also expected to vote on potentially releasing the committee's investigative findings into Gaetz. The panel deadlocked along party lines in a similar vote last month. At the time, the committee's Republican chairman, Representative Michael Guest, told reporters he had ""reservations"" about releasing the report because it was not yet complete. The committee's top Democrat, Representative Susan Wild, said there was no unanimity within the panel on how to move forward with the probe. The Ethics Committee only has jurisdiction over current members of Congress. Because Gaetz has said he does not plan to return for next year's congressional session beginning in January, several Republicans have argued the investigation should be privately concluded.",Reuters,Center,344,"Center  
The article presents information on the U.S. House of Representatives contemplating actions regarding an ethics report on former Congressman Matt Gaetz, while maintaining neutrality and objectivity. It includes factual reporting on the committee's plans, the actions of both Democratic and Republican members, and presents quotes from relevant representatives without showing favoritism towards any political perspective.

379,Mexico’s president will ask Trump to deport non-Mexican migrants directly to their home countries,"MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s president said Thursday she will ask President-elect Donald Trump to deport non-Mexican migrants directly to their home countries, rather than dumping them at the Mexican border. President Claudia Sheinbaum said she hopes to reach an agreement with Trump so that “they send people who come from other countries to their countries of origin.” Mexico, like any other country, is not obligated to accept non-Mexican migrants, but it has agreed to do so in the recent past, especially from countries like Cuba and Venezuela, which often refuse deportation flights from the United States, but may accept them from Mexico. Mexican officials have said they are already making preparations if Trump follows through on his pledge to carry out large-scale deportations of migrants who lack the proper documents once he takes office on Jan. 20. Mexico is obviously fearful of two things: large-scale deportations of Mexican citizens and large numbers of non-Mexicans being deported at border crossings that are ill-equipped to deal with them. Experts estimate there are about 4 million Mexicans living in the U.S. without proper documentation. Mexico is already preparing its consular services in the U.S. with additional manpower to handle deportation cases involving its own citizens. But third-country deported migrants pose a thornier challenge, and could include considerable numbers of Haitians, Cubans and Venezuelans. Between 2022 and 2023, Mexico agreed to accept up to 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, countries that are difficult for the U.S. to deport to for diplomatic or political reasons. That agreement is currently in place. In late 2023, Venezuela said Mexico had repatriated about 300 Venezuelan migrants on two flights. Such returns pose a monetary burden for the Mexican government. Mexico had offered some of the repatriated Venezuelans a stipend of about $110 per month for six months to help them re-establish themselves in their home countries. However, the task of finding jobs, shelter and transportation for deported Mexicans would presents an even greater challenge for Mexico. Migration has long been a sensitive issue between the two countries, and has become even more urgent following Trump’s threat to impose 25% tariffs on Mexican goods unless the country does more to stem the flow of migrants and drugs. In November, Trump claimed that Sheinbaum had “agreed to stop migration through Mexico” following a phone call between the two leaders. Sheinbaum, meanwhile, suggested Mexico was already doing its part and had no interest in closing its borders. “We reiterate that Mexico’s position is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and between peoples,” Sheinbaum said at the time.",WashingtonTimes,Lean Right,435,"Center

6,'Sinister deep staters': Even right-wing Republicans are on Kash Patel’s 'hit list',"Far-right MAGA conspiracy theorist Kash Patel, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for FBI director, has made no secret of his desire to target prominent Democrats for retribution — including President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. But Mother Jones' David Corn, in an article published on December 3, stresses that right-wing non-MAGA Republicans are also plentiful on Patel's ""hit list."" Patel, Corn notes, laid out that ""hit list"" in his 2023 book ""Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy."" READ MORE:Data shows dire election postmortems could soon be in store for GOP: columnist ""This lineup also includes a number of Republicans and onetime Trump appointees,"" Corn explains.

Corn cites Barr as an ""especially absurd"" choice for Patel's ""hit list"" — as he was a staunch Trump defender before they had a falling out over the 2020 presidential election results. ""Barr, as attorney general, undermined (former special counsel Robert) Mueller's investigation of the Trump-Russia scandal — an inquiry that according to Patel was a deep state plot,"" Corn points out. ""Why would a deep state denizen do that? And while Barr did not back up Trump's baseless claim that the 2020 election was rigged against him, he endorsed Trump's presidential campaign this year — another curious move for an anti-Trump conspirator."" Corn notes that Trump has had glowing praise for Patel's ""Government Gangsters"" book. READ MORE: 'Check please!'

Corn adds, ""That indicates Patel's list could end up as a to-do — or to-get — list for Trump. Not only Democrats should worry about that."" On X, former Twitter, conservative Republican Olivia Troye — who served as a national security aide to former Vice President Mike Pence and went on to endorse Kamala Harris for president in 2024 — described a letter she received from Patel. Troye, on December 4, tweeted, ""Today, Kash Patel sent a letter to my counsel @MarkSZaidEsq - threatening legal action & demanding that I retract my comments on MSNBC about his unfitness to serve as FBI Director. This aligns with his threats against the media & political opponents, revealing how he might conduct himself if confirmed in the role.

162,"Search for missing Pennsylvania woman in ""unstable,"" abandoned coal mine enters recovery phase as crews prepare to dig up larger area of land","UNITY TOWNSHIP, Pa. (KDKA) - At least another full day of digging will be needed to find a woman who is believed to have been swallowed by a sinkhole behind a restaurant in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, state police said. ""Unless it's a miracle, most likely this is [a] recovery [effort],"" Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Stephen Limani said. At a 5 p.m. news conference Wednesday, state police said the rescue effort for 64-year-old Elizabeth Pollard has now shifted to a recovery effort. Police, firefighters, mining experts, and search and rescue teams have spent nearly two full days digging, shoring up and searching an abandoned coal mine behind Monday's Restaurant on Marguerite Road in Unity Township. State police said Pollard likely fell into a sinkhole, about the size of a manhole, behind the restaurant sometime between Monday evening and the early hours of Tuesday. She was looking for her cat at the time. Earlier on Wednesday, state police said the mine had become unstable and it was no longer safe for search teams to enter and work in. Now, they plan to dig more of the area out. ""Because of the fragile state of the mine, we've had to change what we were trying to do,"" Limani said. ""We were trying to basically suction the removal of dirt and debris and rocks, and even using water to try and soften the debris up or even push it out of our way to [now] where we have to dig out a massive area, more than four times the size of the area that we had originally done, to try and secure the mine so we can access it to try and go in there and recover her."" Ligonier Construction was called in to help with digging out the old mine. ""It's basically pieces of wood and a little bit of rock side walls and plywood, and it's been there for 75 years,"" Limani said. ""It's been at the same temperature, it's basically been encapsulated, and it's basically 55ish degrees and it's been that way for that long. Now we're introducing freezing cold water, different types of temperatures, you're creating a very rough environment for fragile material and that's some of the hurdles we've encountered."" So far, state police said they do not have a location of where Pollard ended up after falling. They also have not heard any sounds or noises from the mine. However, Limani said they spotted a lone shoe for a second time in the dirt and mud. He said the space they are working in is as fragile as a ""house of cards."" ""Now you've built that house and you're trying to operate inside that house to pull out boulders and move dirt and put high-powered water to break up clay and suck it out, all while you're around a deck of cards, that's about how fragile it is,"" he said. State police have informed Pollard's family that the operation is moving a recovery phase. ""It's just a matter of trying to find her and do right by her family,"" Limani said. ""We had a conversation with them a couple hours ago about where we thought the investigation was. I know we have a lot of hopes, and maybe there is still a glimmer of hope, but based off of oxygen levels being a little lower, even though we've pumped oxygen into the mine, it's lower than what you would want for someone to try and sustain their life. It's been difficult."" Even crews working at the scene have had a hard time dealing with such a difficult and sensitive operation. ""You're risking the safety of yourself and you're risking the safety of others for the potential,"" Limani said. ""As we keep weighing out the risks and the potential just kept getting lower and lower and lower, it feels like a failure. I'm not going to lie. It feels like we've failed, but if somebody else gets hurt, I think it would be worse."" Now that the operation has moved into a recovery phase, crews are wrapping up for the night and will return to the scene in the morning. State police emphasize though that no one is giving up. In the meantime, they are preparing to work during Thursday's inclement weather. Accumulating snow is in the forecast for western Pennsylvania. They are asking for continued support from people who are following their efforts. State police are also thanking the community on behalf of all the workers. Limani said the village of Westmoreland County where this is all taking place is very tightknit. People and restaurants from all over have been bringing food to keep the workers fed and warm. ""Keep rooting for us,"" he said. ""Throughout the course of the incident, we have had well over 100 emergency personnel here at the site working through the night,"" said Pennsylvania State Trooper Cliff Greenfield. ""Some of them have left, many of which have been replaced by other personnel. The efforts are ongoing today. I'd like to also address some rumors that have been going around. We've been made aware of some rumors, one being that Ms. Pollard has been found. That is false. We are still actively searching for Ms. Pollard. We are hopeful that she is found alive."" In an update on Wednesday afternoon, Trooper Greenfield along with Pleasant Unity Volunteer Fire Department Chief John Bacha, provided details on how the search has continued and their efforts to find Pollard. ""We're still working on some cameras, some electronic devices, some canines, for various reasons, to go through and trying to locate Ms. Pollard,"" Chief Bacha said. ""At this point, the scope of the situation and the condition of the mines, it's beyond sending rescuers in."" Bacha went on to say that the roof of the abandoned mine had collapsed in several places and it was unstable. He said that the Bureau of Mines provided them with hand-drawn maps from the 1940s to help them with their search. However, oxygen has become a concern. ""It's now a concern for Ms. Pollard, absolutely. It's oxygen deficient,"" he said. ""At the same time, we've had experts from various areas. Many times we would blow air into it. We have fans, fans are made for that - to blow air, fresh oxygen in. At the same time, that can also create another problem in a coal mine. It can actually pull methane back into an area where we didn't have methane. Right now we have no explosive gases."" At one point, more than 100 people had responded to the scene to assist in the massive search and rescue effort. Crews worked on widening the hole Tuesday and eventually got people down into the mine area. What appeared to be shoe was located while crews were putting cameras and mics underground, but they haven't seen or heard Pollard as of yet. Pleasant Unity Volunteer Fire Department Chief John Bacha said no carbon monoxide or explosive gases were detected in the atmosphere underground. Authorities said the temperature in the mine is warmer than the outside air, estimating it was around 50 degrees Tuesday afternoon, much warmer than freezing temperatures above ground. Limani said Pollard's family is understandably ""having a rough go with it."" Elizabeth Pollard's son, Axel Hayes, spoke about his mother's disappearance on Tuesday evening, saying he has gone through many emotions, but hopes first responders find Pollard alive. Dozens of first responders, from police to firefighters and search and rescue teams, were on the scene at Monday's Restaurant on Marguerite Road looking for Pollard. In a press conference on Tuesday evening, state police said they haven't been able to make contact with Pollard more than 24 hours after she disappeared, but crews have been able to get into the abandoned mine where she fell and it's still considered a rescue mission. State police said Pollard was last seen in the area around 5 p.m. on Monday calling for Pepper, her lost cat. Hours later, around 1 a.m. Tuesday, a family member called state police to report that Pollard had not come home. Troopers went out searching for her in the area of Monday's Restaurant and discovered her car just before 3 a.m. parked behind the building.",CBS,Lean Left,1374,"Center

29,ICE is looking for a new detention center in Blue California. The state probably can’t stop it,"Federal immigration authorities are looking for a potential new detention center in Northern California, an effort that alarms advocates and some Democratic state lawmakers as President-elect Donald Trump gears up to unleash his mass deportation plan. Federal immigration authorities are looking for a potential new detention center in Northern California, an effort that alarms advocates and some Democratic state lawmakers as President-elect Donald Trump gears up to unleash his mass deportation plan. In August, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a request for information to identify additional detention bed space in the state as other federal agencies intensified border enforcement. The effort began in the wake of the Biden administration’s sweeping asylum ban, implemented in June, for migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border outside designated entry points. Under the ban, border agents can deport such migrants within hours or days without considering their asylum claims. Advocates say an expansion of detention space would give Trump a runway to carry out more mass deportations in California. Immigrants in counties with more detention space are more likely to be arrested and detained, according to research by advocacy groups. Unlike in Texas, where state officials are offering up land to the Trump administration to facilitate mass deportations, California tried to ban new federal immigrant detention centers from opening during the first Trump administration. The court blocked that, ruling that the state was unconstitutionally overstepping on federal immigration enforcement. California Attorney General Rob Bonta told CalMatters that the state may be powerless to stop the possibility of a new facility. Federal documents show ICE issued the request for information on Aug. 14. Such requests can pave the way for federal contracts, in this case to obtain “available detention facilities for single adult populations (male and female)” in Arizona, New Mexico, Washington, Oregon, and California. Its request says the facilities should each have from 850 to 950 detention beds and “may be publicly or privately owned and publicly or privately operated.” One of the facilities should be within a two-hour drive of the San Francisco field office, the documents state. The request also seeks facilities near field offices in Phoenix, El Paso, and Seattle. “ICE has identified a need for immigration detention services within the Western U.S. area of responsibility,” ICE spokesman Richard Beam wrote in an email to CalMatters. “The proposed services are part of ICE’s effort to continually review its detention requirements and explore options that will afford ICE the operational flexibility needed to house the full range of detainees in the agency’s custody.” Currently, ICE detains roughly 38,000 people every day in about 120 immigration jails across the country. In California, that number is just under 3,000 detainees each day, held in six facilities, according to the most recently available immigration data maintained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. That’s the third-largest population of detained immigrants in the country. While ICE, the federal agency responsible for immigration enforcement, owns and operates a very small number of facilities nationwide, it mostly contracts with private prison operators such as CoreCivic, GEO Group, and Management and Training Corp. Their detention facilities house 80% of ICE’s detainees. Stock for CoreCivic and GEO Group soared upon Trump’s win last month. In California, private, for-profit prison companies run all six ICE detention facilities – the Golden State Annex and Mesa Verde detention facilities in Kern County; the Adelanto Detention Facility and Desert View Annex, both in San Bernardino County; the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego County; and the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Imperial County. Across all six, the federal government has the capacity to detain up to 7,188 people statewide. State Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Democrat from Los Angeles, said she was concerned about the potential economic impacts of ICE having an increased capacity for detention and, therefore, deportations. “The expansion of detention in California concerns everyone in our state. Expanding detention correlates with increased ICE raids and family separation, all of which has devastating social and economic impacts for California,” she said. “In addition, these facilities are run by private for-profit companies that consistently place their bottom-line profit above the health and safety of those who work in or are detained in these facilities.” Advocates argue that detention expansions lead to human rights abuses and undermine community safety. “An expansion of ICE detention operations within the Bay Area and Northern California is going to be part of a reign of terror on our communities the Trump administration is threatening,” said Bree Bernwanger, a senior staff attorney on the Immigrants’ Rights team at the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California. “We already know from existing facilities within California that ICE does not and cannot maintain safe and or healthy standards of confinement for people inside.” The ACLU is suing to learn more about the federal agency’s expanded detention plans. Bernwanger was referring to issues like complaints of sexually abusive patdowns. Also, in 2023, ICE allegedly retaliated against hunger strikers by storming into their cells, violently dragging them, threatening them with forced feedings, and then providing food that was not appropriate for breaking a 21-day fast, prompting a medical condition in at least one inmate, according to a claim filed by the inmate, who was represented by two advocacy groups. In August, the civil liberties organization released a 34-page report detailing 485 grievances filed by detainees across six immigration detention facilities in California between 2023 and June 2024. Those grievances included allegations of hazardous facilities, inhumane treatment, medical neglect, and retaliation. ICE declined to comment on the report. In December 2019, California passed a law that would have banned private immigration detention centers. It was part of a wave of resistance by California Democrats to the first Trump administration. It also prohibited the state from using for-profit prisons for any inmates starting in 2028. The for-profit facilities “contribute to over-incarceration” and “do not reflect our values,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement when signing the bill. Days before the law was set to go into effect, ICE signed new contracts for its facilities in California. The federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals later overturned the state’s ban on private prisons. Bonta, who wrote the unsuccessful ban as an Oakland assemblymember, told CalMatters in November that the state might not be able to stop ICE from opening another detention facility outside of San Francisco. “It’s a matter of federal jurisdiction,” Bonta said. “It’s federal. I disagree, but my office’s disagreement was considered, and the court determined that it was a federal issue.” This story was originally published by CalMatters and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",APNEWS,Left,1108,"Lean Left

4,Biden administration backs off proposed overhaul of apprenticeship programs,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — President Joe Biden’s administration has withdrawn a proposed overhaul of workplace apprenticeship programs after facing pushback from business groups concerned about the costs and Republican state attorneys general opposed to new diversity requirements. The U.S. Department of Labor confirmed Wednesday that it won’t be moving forward with a proposed rewrite of the National Apprenticeship System rules. A department spokesperson declined to explain why the proposal was withdrawn. The agency had previously cited a need to modernize an on-the-job-training system that has remained largely the same since 2008. Registered apprenticeship programs approved by the federal government or states provided training and education for hundreds of thousands of workers in fields ranging from construction to manufacturing to public administration. The proposed rule change would have required apprenticeship program sponsors to recruit people from “underserved communities,” which it defined to include women, people of color, those with disabilities and people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, among others. It also would have required state apprenticeship agencies to develop plans for advancing diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility. A group of two dozen Republican state attorneys general objected, asserting the proposal could have run awry of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that prohibited race as a deciding factor in college admissions, striking down affirmative action programs. Some business groups asserted that increased oversight and reporting requirements could have driven up costs of apprenticeship programs while other proposed changes could have reduced flexibility and participation. The proposal would have required at least 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, eliminating an option to finish sooner for workers who prove their competence. The decision to back off the rule change was welcomed by Associated Builders and Contractors, which has about 450 government-registered apprenticeship programs in 20 occupations. The proposal amounted to “a massive increase in red tape” that would have made the apprenticeship system “even more complicated and less attractive,” said Ben Brubeck, the group’s vice president of regulatory, labor and state affairs.",APNEWS,Left,331,"Center  
The article objectively discusses the Biden administration's withdrawal of a proposed overhaul of apprenticeship programs, focusing on the facts and responses from various stakeholders such as business groups and state attorneys general. It presents both sides of the debate—highlighting concerns over costs and diversity requirements—without leaning toward a particular political ideology, thus maintaining a neutral stance."
138,Pete Hegseth Will Make The Pentagon Great Again,"Pete Hegseth has the combat leadership experience, academic pedigree, and profound love of country necessary to make our military great again. I served with him in the 34th Infantry Division and succeeded him in leading Concerned Veterans for America, and I wholeheartedly endorse his nomination to be our next secretary of defense. President Trump knows that the Pentagon is in desperate need of reform, and the best way to accomplish that is to send a true outsider to run the show. The Make America Great Again movement has no better outsider to fix our broken military than Pete Hegseth, and he will also be a true loyalist to President Trump’s agenda. Hegseth’s leadership will ensure our military returns to the basics of defeating our adversaries, rather than pushing a social justice agenda. Our military is in the midst of a readiness and recruitment crisis, and reform is needed fast. Hegseth and I served as infantry rifle platoon leaders in combat. Warfighters don’t have the luxury of being distracted by frivolous matters during combat operations. We focused on what I called the Big Four: shoot, move, communicate, and stop bleeding. Transgender surgeries and understanding white rage didn’t quite make the list. I served as the executive director of Concerned Veterans for America (CVA), succeeding Hegseth, who brought this group to national prominence. Contrary to media reports based on anonymous sources, I can confirm that Hegseth was not fired. It was common knowledge within CVA that he was going to Fox News. This is nothing more than another tired media attack from an apparatus hell-bent on destroying his nomination. The media have falsely portrayed CVA as a dysfunctional organization under Hegseth’s leadership, but the executive team and strategy I inherited from him were world-class. The proof is in the policy victories we helped President Trump deliver for veterans by reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2017 and 2018. I personally briefed President Trump on CVA’s policy proposals during a roundtable discussion with other leaders from Veteran Service Organizations. My message was developed in part by the Fixing Veterans Health Care Task Force, created by Pete Hegseth. We wanted to bring accountability to the VA and provide veterans with a choice in their health care, and we did just that. The president agreed with our strategy. I quickly deployed the CVA grassroots army, which Hegseth built, to pressure Congress to pass these critically needed reforms. Our volunteers made thousands of citizen contacts by knocking on doors, hosting phone banks, and calling their members of Congress. In less than six months, President Trump signed the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. This would allow the government to fire bad and underperforming VA employees, especially the ones who allowed vets to die on secret waitlists. The next summer, President Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which provided vets with a choice in their health care. Thanks to the policy vision of Pete Hegseth and the leadership of President Trump, these reforms brought the VA into the 21st century and likely saved thousands of lives. That is the Pete Hegseth I know — a warfighter and visionary who loves his country. He will make a tremendous secretary of defense.",Federalist,Right,534,"Right  
The article clearly exhibits a strong pro-Trump sentiment, endorsing Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense while criticizing media portrayals undermining him. The language used suggests a defense of conservative values and a rejection of social justice issues in military contexts, indicating a commitment to right-wing agendas and perspectives. This focus on loyalty to Trump and promotion of conservative reform efforts further cements its classification on the right."
250,Hegseth nomination sinking fast in the Senate,"Senate Republicans say Pete Hegseth, President-elect Trump’s choice to head the Defense Department, faces a very tough path to confirmation in the Senate and his bleak prospects have been communicated directly to the Trump transition team, which is now mulling other options. Senate sources say there is a block of likely “hard no’s” in the Senate GOP conference and identify Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as lawmakers who view Hegseth’s nomination very skeptically. “I don’t know that there’s a real clear path,” said one Republican senator, adding that colleagues “are very apprehensive” about Hegseth’s nomination. “It’s damaging to the president,” the senator added. “It doesn’t help us in the Senate.” Hegseth waged a significant effort to salvage his nomination Wednesday, including by pledging to Republican senators that he would stop drinking if confirmed as secretary of Defense. And some Republican senators, even those who are defense hawks, think Hegseth could be a good choice to lead the Pentagon, citing his background as a decorated combat veteran and his lack of deep connections to the Defense Department’s network of generals who tend to resist big changes. But Republicans are also hoping to be spared the headache and embarrassment of public confirmation hearings in which women who have accused Hegseth of sexual misconduct or former colleagues who have accused him of unprofessional behavior might testify. GOP lawmakers say they don’t want to publicly call for Hegseth to resign based on anonymous allegations. They argue that a key difference between Hegseth and former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who recently dropped his bid to become attorney general, is that Hegseth’s accusers haven’t testified in sworn depositions like Gaetz’s accusers did. But the accumulation of damaging allegations against the nominee is alarming Republican senators. A second GOP senator said Hegseth appears “headed” for defeat in the Senate Armed Services Committee or on the Senate floor if he doesn’t withdraw. The lawmaker said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a staunch Trump ally, has floated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) as a possible alternative to Hegseth. Another Republican senator familiar with Trump’s deliberations over what to do about Hegseth’s nomination said the president-elect himself floated DeSantis’s name as a potential replacement to a group of people. “I think some of these articles are very disturbing,” Graham told CBS News on Tuesday. “He obviously has a chance to defend himself here, but some of this stuff is going to be difficult.” Asked Wednesday about his conversations with Trump, Graham told The Hill: “I said to him what I said to everybody else.” Graham argued Hegseth should have a chance to defend himself from allegations of sexual and financial misconduct and excessive drinking. “I’ve known him for a long time. All this stuff is new to me. I’m not going to tank him because of anonymous sources. Somebody’s got to come forward and make a credible allegation. He deserves a chance to defend himself. Those accusing him of something need to come forward,” Graham said. “The allegations are anonymous. If they’re true, he’ll have a hard time,” he said. Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Hegseth needs to put a hard stop to his drinking. “I need to be convinced he’s not going to drink anymore. I know it sounds oversimplistic, but I also think it contributes to all of his other problems, his substance abuse. I’m way too familiar with it in my own family, and nobody wants a secretary of Defense that’s got a drinking problem,” Cramer said. Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), the incoming chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Hegseth pledged to him at a meeting Wednesday morning that he would stop drinking if confirmed. “I think that’s probably a good idea,” Wicker told reporters. Two sources familiar with the matter confirmed to The Hill that Trump is weighing alternative options in the event Hegseth is forced to withdraw, though Trump has not yet signaled he’s giving up on Hegseth. Trump has spoken with DeSantis about the prospect of the top Pentagon job, and DeSantis is open to the role, one source said. The Florida governor served in the Navy and is aligned with Trump’s vision to eliminate “woke” aspects of the military. Trump and DeSantis saw each other Tuesday at a memorial for fallen Florida law enforcement officers. Other names that have been floated for the role include Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Elbridge Colby, who served in a deputy role in the Defense Department during Trump’s first term. One Senate Republican aide said Ernst has to proceed extremely carefully in how she handles Hegseth’s nomination if she wants to get the nod as Trump’s plan B to lead the Defense Department. The source warned that Ernst would enrage Trump’s MAGA base if she’s viewed as the senator responsible for sinking Hegseth’s nomination. Ernst told reporters she had a “frank and thorough” conversation with Hegseth after meeting with him for 45 minutes Wednesday afternoon. She declined to entertain any speculation about her leading the Defense Department if Hegseth flames out. “Pete is the nominee,” she said. Hegseth has shown no signs of backing down. He penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed claiming he was the target of a “manufactured media takedown.” He went on Megyn Kelly’s SiriusXM show, where he said Trump reiterated his support during a conversation earlier Wednesday and likened his situation to that of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court justice who was confirmed after a bitter process in which he was accused of sexual assault. Hegseth’s mother, Penelope Hegseth, appeared on “Fox & Friends” to push back on a New York Times report about an email she sent her son in 2017 criticizing his treatment of women. She has since said she regretted sending the note. Penelope Hegseth specifically used the appearance on Fox to appeal to female senators, whom she urged to keep an open mind about her son’s nomination. “He’s a changed man. And I just hope people will get to know who Pete is today,” Penelope Hegseth said. “Especially our dear female senators. That you would listen to him. Listen with your heart to the truth of Pete.” One source in Trump’s orbit noted the media blitz was unusual for the president-elect’s nominees. Not even Gaetz went on television to try to salvage his nomination as it faltered. While Senate GOP aide warned of the block of “hard no’s” Hegseth will face in the conference, anpther predicted that more damaging revelations are likely to surface. “It could always get worse,” the second aide said. “The FBI background check is not going to be fun.” Al Weaver contributed.",TheHill,Center,1112,"Center  
The article presents a balanced view of Pete Hegseth's nomination process, incorporating multiple perspectives from Senate Republicans, including both support and skepticism. It details allegations against Hegseth while acknowledging his qualifications and the support he has from some GOP members. The tone remains neutral without overtly favoring any political stance, which is characteristic of centrist reporting.

143,White House Says ‘Expect’ More Pardons at End of Joe Biden’s Term,"“Expect” President Joe Biden to issue more pardons “at the end of this term,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Monday on Air Force One. Jean-Pierre’s statement came before Politico reported Biden is weighing giving preemptive pardons to his allies in Congress and current and former federal officials, such as Liz Cheney, Adam Schiff, and Anthony Fauci. Some Republicans speculate Joe Biden might pardon more members of his family who were/are involved in the family business. “Can we expect that other people who are in prison whose clemency petitions are sitting at the White House are going to have their cases see the same care and attention that the president gave his own son?” a reporter asked Jean-Pierre. Jean-Pierre said Americans can expect more pardons: As it relates to pardon- — pardoning or any clemency, the president, as you know, at the end of the year, makes announcements. He’s thinking through that process very thoroughly. There’s a process in place, obviously. And so, once — I’m not going to get ahead of — of the president on this. But you could expect more announcement, more par- — pardons and clemency at the end of — at the end of — at the end of this term. Democrats and media allies have urged Joe Biden for weeks to issue preemptive pardons to his allies. Those on the list include Christopher Wray, Justice Department lawyers, Joe Biden himself, the whole Biden family, Liz Cheney, Mark Milley, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, and Adam Kinzinger, among others. Jill Wine-Banks, a former assistant Watergate special prosecutor, was “relieved and thrilled” that Joe Biden pardoned Hunter Biden and encouraged him to issue preemptive pardons to those “threatened by the injustice.” “I hope that President Biden will also issue preemptive pardons to all of those people threatened by the injustice of what will become the Department of Justice in the Trump administration,” she told MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart. “That, of course, includes Jack Smith and all of his staff, many Department of Justice lawyers.” “It includes President Biden himself, although we don’t know that anyone can legally pardon themselves,” Wine-Banks continued. “He will need a pardon because he is going to be harassed and charged for no crimes whatsoever. Donald Trump has promised that.” Breitbart News’s senior legal contributor Ken Klukowski discusses whether or not a president can pardon himself in “The Truth About the Growing Hunter Biden Pardon Scandal.” Wendell Husebo is a political reporter with Breitbart News and a former RNC War Room Analyst.

21,Slain UnitedHealthcare CEO Was Accused Of Insider Trading Amid DOJ Probe,"UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was facing a lawsuit accusing him and other executives of insider trading related to an ongoing Justice Department investigation before he was fatally shot outside a New York City hotel on Wednesday. Thompson, 50, was one of three UnitedHealth Group executives named in a class action lawsuit filed in May that accused them of dumping millions of dollars worth of stock while the company was the subject of a federal antitrust investigation, which investors say wasn’t immediately disclosed to shareholders. “UnitedHealth was aware of the DOJ investigation since at least October 2023. Instead of disclosing this material investigation to investors or the public, UnitedHealth insiders sold more than $120 million of their personally held UnitedHealth shares,” the suit filed by the City of Hollywood Firefighters’ Pension Fund alleges. Nearly $25 billion in shareholder value was erased once the investigation was publicly revealed in February. Thompson was able to sell off more than $15 million of his own UnitedHealth shares before the value dropped, however, the suit states. It was the first time that Thompson had sold shares since becoming CEO of the company’s insurance division in 2021, Crain’s New York Business reported back in April. Attorneys listed as representing Thompson in the suit did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Thursday. Police have not identified a suspect or possible motive in the shooting as of Thursday morning. The assassin was able to take off on a bicycle, though they reportedly left shell casings at the scene with the words “deny,” “defend” and “depose” on them, law enforcement sources told ABC and NBC News. Thompson’s wife, Paulette, told NBC News on Wednesday that her husband had been the subject of threats related to a lack of medical coverage. “I don’t know details. I just know that he said there were some people that had been threatening him,” she told the outlet. Despite the threats, she said, her husband didn’t change his travel routine. The couple share two sons and had been living separately in Minneapolis for several years, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing property records, voter registration data and neighbors. Thompson was in New York ahead of an annual investors conference. The DOJ’s investigation has focused on potential conflicts between the company’s insurance unit and its Optum health services arm, including favoritism toward the physician groups acquired by Optum and challenges imposed on rivaling health insurers, as The Wall Street Journal reported. UnitedHealth Group has faced ongoing scrutiny from the DOJ over concerns about monopolization in the health care market. Last month, the DOJ sued to block UnitedHealth Group’s purchase of the rivaling home health and hospice company Amedisys, alleging that the merger would reduce competition and the number of health and hospice services in the U.S. UnitedHealth Group accused the DOJ of “overreacting” and vowed to fight its lawsuit. The DOJ separately tried to stop UnitedHealth Group’s acquisition of Change Healthcare in 2022, alleging that the acquisition of the health-technology firm would potentially violate antitrust laws, though a judge ultimately disagreed.",Huffpost,Left,508,"Center

165,"How Trump’s Tariffs Could Impact Top Imports From Mexico, Canada, and China","President-elect Donald Trump has announced a plan to impose tariffs on all products imported from America’s three largest trading partners: Mexico, Canada, and China. The move could impact the prices of a range of imported goods, from cars to electronics, experts say. Trump said on Truth Social on Monday night that he intends to sign an executive order on Jan. 20, 2025, to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% tariff on all products coming into the U.S., and a 10% tariff on goods from China. He said the tariffs would be in response to migrants and drugs, such as fentanyl, traveling across U.S. borders. Trump initially promised during his campaign to institute a 10-20% tariff on all imports, and as high as 60% on goods from China. Economists worry that his tariff plan will raise the prices of some imported goods and lead to inflation. “This is a time when U.S. consumers have expressed a lot of dissatisfaction with inflation, and arguably elected Trump because of that dissatisfaction,” says Kimberly Clausing, former lead economist in the Biden Administration’s Office of Tax Policy. “[Trump’s proposed tariffs] will be quite expensive for U.S. consumers. It will also be very costly for U.S. manufacturers and U.S. job creation because North American manufacturing is very integrated across these borders.” Read More: What Donald Trump’s Win Means for Inflation The higher prices of imported goods could also prompt domestic producers to raise the prices of their goods, according to Alan Deardorff, emeritus professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. Deardorff says the tariffs could lead to companies moving production out of impacted countries. Trump hasn’t released further details about his plan, so economists say it’s unclear what, if any, products will be exempted from the tariffs. Here are the top imports the U.S. gets from Mexico, Canada, and China that could be impacted by the proposed tariffs. Mexico is the U.S.’s top trading partner, according to U.S. Census Bureau data from September. The main products Mexico exports are cars and car parts, as well as electrical machinery and appliances, such as laundry machines, according to data from The Atlas of Economic Complexity. Trump’s proposed tariffs could make these cars and appliances built in Mexico, or cars and appliances assembled in the U.S. but that have parts imported from Mexico, more expensive, economists predict. “[Mexico makes] a lot of parts associated with our manufacturing production, so when you buy a product—it could be something simple like a toaster or a household appliance—some part of that will be a little more expensive because of these tariffs,” Clausing says. “So there’s going to be some really direct impact on certain items, and an indirect impact on many other items that will push up price level in the U.S. economy.” The U.S. also gets foods like meat and fish from Mexico, according to Sharyn O’Halloran, professor of political economy at Columbia University, and Trump’s tariffs could drive up those prices too. America’s second-largest partner is Canada. The U.S. is the top destination for Canada’s exports, the majority of which are crude oils, petroleum gas, lumber, and cars and car parts, according to data from The Atlas of Economic Complexity. If Trump follows through on his tariff plan, the price of lumber imported from Canada could go up—and, in turn, that could increase construction costs in the U.S., O’Halloran says. Tariffs could also raise the cost of home heating oil, as well as gas prices in the U.S., according to Clausing. China ranks third among the U.S.’s main trading partners. The U.S. is the top destination for China’s exports, which mainly include electronics—such as phones, televisions, and computers, according to data from The Atlas of Economic Complexity. Trump’s tariffs could increase the cost of electronics like phones and televisions sold in the U.S. but made in China. During the previous Trump Administration, U.S. trade officials created some exceptions to tariffs imposed on China, including removing tariffs on certain Apple products assembled in China. It’s unclear if Trump will create exceptions again, or if he’ll follow through with his tariffs plan. But economists are concerned that, if he does, countries may retaliate. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum responded to Trump’s announcement by suggesting that Mexico would retaliate with tariffs of their own against the U.S. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to Trump about the proposed tariffs, saying afterward that they had a ""good"" phone call discussing the situation. Many Canadian officials have slammed Trump’s proposed tariffs, and Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that Canada would have to retaliate if Trump follows through with his plan. “It’s going to be very bad for the North American economy if this scenario unfolds as promised. We can hope that it’s just an elaborate bluff,” Clausing says. “The problem with that hope is that Trump has built his whole campaign around high tariffs. I find it hard to think that it was all just a bluff.”",TIME,Lean Left,825,"Lean Left

271,Head of Democratic Caucus says thin House margins make attendance vital next year,"The head of the House Democratic Caucus is sending an early message to his troops heading into the 119th Congress: Attendance will be crucial given the razor-tight margins in the lower chamber. “It’s important for every member to come to work and to do their job. That’s what we’re telling our caucus,” Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) said during a press briefing in the Capitol. “Their attendance is incredibly important, and the work that we do here is important, and pushing back against Republican overreach is potentially something that we have to do next year,” he continued. “And in order to do that, we’re going to need them coming” to Washington. While Democrats generally fared poorly in this year’s elections — losing the Senate and White House while failing to flip the House — the party outperformed the top of the ticket in the lower chamber, where GOP leaders will have just a spare 220 to 215 advantage in the next Congress. That thin advantage will get even thinner in the early part of next year, as Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Michael Waltz (R-Fla.) are set to join the Trump administration, while former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) — who won reelection last month — has already resigned ahead of his failed bid to lead the Justice Department in Trump’s second term. Those shifts will leave Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who’s expected to keep the gavel in the next Congress, with a hairline 217 to 215 majority for several months of 2025, when President-elect Trump is hoping to use the GOP majorities in Congress to move an ambitious 100-day agenda that includes a sweeping extension of his 2017 tax cuts. The tiny cushion means GOP leaders will have to achieve perfect unity among Republican lawmakers in order to pass their partisan agenda, since even a single defection would lead to a tie — 216 to 216 — which spells failure under House rules. The math changes, however, if there are Democratic absences, which would lower the threshold Republicans would need to pass their bills, thereby padding their cushion to allow more GOP defections. It’s that scenario that Aguilar and other Democratic leaders are already fighting to avoid by encouraging every member to be in the chamber when hot-button legislation hits the floor. The Democratic Caucus chairman said he’s sympathetic to lawmakers who are suffering from serious illnesses, including several with cancer, but quickly emphasized that those members volunteered to seek reelection, even knowing of their health troubles. “That’s life, but members also ran for these jobs,” Aguilar said. “Members ran for these jobs and were reelected knowing that that was what they were experiencing. And if they asked their voters to send them to D.C. to do work, my expectation is that they’re going to come to D.C. to do work. “That’s how I approach it.”",NewsNaiton,Center,475,"Lean Left

These are fraudulent votes."" A state investigation found that Andrews was dropping off ballots for himself, his wife and their three adult children, who all lived at the same address. That is legal in Georgia, and an investigator said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Andrews. The film suggests that ballot ""mules"" aligned with Democrats were paid to illegally collect and deliver ballots in Georgia and four other closely watched states. An Associated Press analysis found that it is based on faulty assumptions, anonymous accounts and improper analysis of cellphone location data. D'Souza's statement says interviews in the film make clear that True the Vote ""was correlating the videos to geolocation data."" But, he wrote, ""We recently learned that surveillance videos used in the film may not have actually been correlated with the geolocation data."" He acknowledged that the film and book ""create the impression that these individuals were mules that had been identified as suspected ballot harvesters based on their geotracked cell phone data."" Though their faces were blurred, Andrews has publicly come forth and sued over the use of his image, and D'Souza said he owes Andrews an apology. He said the surveillance videos in the film ""were characterized on the basis of inaccurate information provided to me and my team"" and that if he'd known they weren't linked to geolocation data, ""I would have clarified this and produced and edited the film differently."" But D'Souza said he continues to have confidence in True the Vote's work and in the basic message of the film, that the 2020 election was not secure and ""there was systematic election fraud sufficient to call the outcome into question."" State and federal authorities have said there was no evidence of widespread fraud in that election. True the Vote issued a ""clarification"" Monday on D'Souza's statement. It says the central premise of the film ""remains accurate,"" but says it had no editorial control and didn't select the videos or graphics used. Andrews was not part of the ""geospatial study"" True the Vote did, ""a fact that was communicated to Mr. D'Souza's team."" ""Despite this, D'Souza's team included a blurred video of this individual in their '2000 Mules' movie and book productions,"" the statement says. Andrews filed a federal lawsuit in October 2022 against D'Souza, True the Vote and Salem Media Group. Salem Media Group, the publisher of ""2000 Mules,"" issued a statement in May apologizing to Andrews and saying it had removed the films from its platforms and would not further distribute the film or book. A few days later, Andrews dismissed his claims against Salem. D'Souza said his apology to Andrews was not made ""under the terms of a settlement agreement or other duress, but because it is the right thing to do, given what we have now learned."" Lawyers for Andrews did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",NPR,Lean Left,649,"Lean Left  
This classification stems from the article's critical tone toward the film ""2000 Mules,"" highlighting the inaccuracies and the apology issued by its creator, Dinesh D'Souza. It references established assessments that dispute the film’s claims of widespread election fraud, indicating a tendency to align more with mainstream media narratives that usually lean left. The inclusion of statements from state and federal authorities further supports the left-leaning perspective on the topic."

Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day. President Biden has signed a full and unconditional pardon for his son Hunter Biden. The pardon comes just seven weeks before he leaves office. President Biden granted the clemency despite repeated pledges that he wouldn't pardon his son. Hunter was convicted of federal gun charges for lying on a federal background check form about his drug addiction when purchasing a gun. In another case, he pleaded guilty to tax offenses for failing to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes. Sentencing was scheduled for later this month, and he could have faced prison time. President-elect Donald Trump says he'll nominate Kash Patel, a close ally and former national security aide, to serve as the next director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This sets up a move to replace the current director, Chris Wray, who has two years left on his term. Patel has criticized the country's top law enforcement agency and has been vocal about his plans to change it. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has vowed to ""crush"" the rebels who made territorial gains in Syria over the weekend. Syria's 13-year civil war has long been at a stalemate, but this renewed fighting poses the biggest threat to the ruling regime in years. The rebel advancement comes as Russia, a key ally of Syria, is stretched in its war with Ukraine. Here's what to know about the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), and how it pulled off the stunning seizure of Aleppo, Syria's second most populous city. It's the time of year to pull out Christmas decorations and decide what kind of tree to garnish: real or plastic. With this decision comes the age-old question: Are real Christmas trees or their fake counterparts more eco-friendly? Here's what studies and environmentalists say. Acclaimed photographer George Steinmetz and his drones traveled to 36 countries, 27 U.S. states and five oceans to document food production. The goal: Examine the way food makes its way to feed a constantly growing population. The photos are featured in his latest book, Feed the Planet: A Photographic Journey to the World's Food, with accompanying text by journalist Joel K. Bourne Jr., who documents the food-print these practices leave on our environment. This newsletter was edited by Suzanne Nuyen.",NPR,Lean Left,408,"Lean Left  
The article discusses President Biden's pardon of his son, which can be seen as a politically sensitive topic, particularly as it contrasts his earlier commitments. The inclusion of environmental themes and social issues, like food production, leans toward a progressive view. Moreover, the newsletter mentions political figures like Donald Trump without presenting an adversarial or favorable stance, suggesting a lighter editorial approach rather than overt bias. Overall, the language and topics presented lean toward progressive considerations, characteristic of ""Lean Left"" media."
236,UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson shot and killed in NYC. Police say it was a targeted attack.,"NEW YORK -- UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed in what appears to be a targeted attack Wednesday morning outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan, according to the New York City Police Department. Police said the 50-year-old CEO was shot once in the back and once in the leg. He was rushed to Mount Sinai West hospital, but did not survive his injuries. Now, it's all hands on deck as the NYPD hunts for his killer. Investigators are scouring surveillance cameras to trace the suspect, and combing through Thompson's phone and social media to see if he received any personal threats. ""I want to be clear, at this time, every indication is that this was a premeditated, preplanned, targeted attack,"" NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a news conference Wednesday. ""The motive for this murder currently is unknown, but, based on the evidence we have so far, it does appear that the victim was specifically targeted. But at this point, we do not know why,"" NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny added. A spokesperson for UnitedHealthcare told CBS News the shooting took place during the company's investors conference. It was scheduled to be livestreamed from a hotel ballroom starting at 8 a.m., but it was canceled after the shooting. ""This does not appear to be a random act of violence,"" said Mayor Eric Adams. Gov. Kathy Hochul called the shooting ""horrific"" and directed New York State Police to assist the NYPD with the investigation. ""Our hearts are with the family and loved ones of Mr. Thompson and we are committed to ensuring the perpetrator is brought to justice,"" Hochul said in a statement. Surveillance video obtained by CBS News New York shows Thompson walking down the street when the suspect appears behind him, takes aim, and shoots him once in the back. Thompson falls to the ground, as the gunman appears to clear a jam from his gun and fires again. The gunman then fires a third time before running across the street. ""It appears the suspect was lying in wait for several minutes and, as the victim was walking to the conference hotel, the suspect approached from behind,"" Tisch said. ""Many people passed the suspect, but he appeared to wait for his intended target."" The gunman was last seen wearing a black face mask, brown or cream jacket, black and white sneakers and gray backpack. Police said the suspect fled into the alley between West 54th and West 55th streets, then rode a bike up to Central Park, where he was seen at 6:48 a.m. on Center Drive. CBS News obtained additional surveillance footage that sources say appears to show the suspect cycling out of the park on West 85th Street just before 7 a.m., about 15 minutes after the shooting. ""What we're looking at is a gunman who was thoughtful and prepared, staked out the scene, began by shooting the person in the back,"" said CBS News law enforcement contributor Rich Esposito, a former NYPD deputy commissioner. Esposito said the gunman may have planned carefully, but not perfectly. ""It's not perfect preparation in that there is evidence left in the form of shell casings. There's evidence left from prior to the shooting,"" Esposito said. Police said the suspect went to a nearby Starbucks minutes before the shooting. Sources told CBS News surveillance images there may have captured enough of the suspect's face to run it through facial recognition programs. Police sources also said investigators are running forensic tests on a water bottle and candy bar wrapper they believe he left there, as well as on a discarded cellphone found near the scene. Esposito said detectives will also likely search for discarded clothing along the path. ""One of the first things someone who is remotely sophisticated does is change their clothing, change their hat, probably not their sneakers. That helps them flee,"" he said. The wait, murder and getaway happened in a span of just nine minutes. One witness said he was sitting inside his car when he heard a gunshot and saw a man running away with a gun in his hand. ""I was looking at my phone and I hear the shot,"" he said. ""I was shocked. It was the first time I've ever seen a crime right in front of me. Now I fear he could shoot me, too."" The deadly shooting happened shortly after 6:45 a.m. outside the Hilton Midtown hotel on Sixth Avenue near West 54th Street. More than a dozen officers responded and blocked off West 54th Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues for the morning commute. ""We are deeply saddened by this morning's events in the area and our thoughts are with all affected by the tragedy,"" a spokesperson for the hotel said in a statement. Investigators began gathering surveillance video from surrounding buildings and interviewing anyone who may have seen what happened. ""What we know is that the shooter arrived at the location on foot about five minutes prior to the victim's arrival. He stands alongside the building line, as numerous other people and pedestrians pass him by,"" Kenny said. Sources told CBS News the weapon used had a silencer on it. Three bullet casings were recovered at the scene, along with three live rounds ejected from the gun when the shooter cleared the jam. UnitedHealthcare security and investigators are combing through files for any possible previous threats, disgruntled or recently fired employees, a law enforcement source told CBS News. Police sources told CBS News detectives uncovered ""rantings"" against big pharma directed at UnitedHealthcare, but no specific threats to Thompson's personal safety. ""We're looking at everything, we're looking at his social media, we are interviewing employees, we are interviewing family members, we will be speaking to local law enforcement in Minnesota,"" said Kenny. ""They're gonna look at the business end. You have a company that has laid people off. They're gonna look at the personal stories and they're gonna focus on letters, desperate people who were denied care or tests or something that could have saved a life who will blame the company,"" Former NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence and Counterterrorism John Miller said. Security experts say not all high-level executives want to bother with a circle of protection. ""They think it's a violation of their privacy. They think it's a little pretentious. It draws attention to them. They think: who would want to hurt them?"" said Ed Davis, of LLC Security and Management Consulting. UnitedHealthcare is based in Minnesota, where the Gov. Tim Walz and other leaders reacted to news of the shooting. ""This is horrifying news and a terrible loss for the business and health care community in Minnesota,"" Walz posted on social media. ""Minnesota is sending our prayers to Brian's family and the UnitedHealthcare team."" Thompson had been with UnitedHealthcare since 2004 and was named CEO in 2021, according to its website. He was a father of two and an active member of his community. ""We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him,"" UnitedHealth Group said in a statement. ""We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian's family and all who were close to him."" Thompson's family released this statement on the killing: Thompson's death sent shockwaves through the health industry. Stephen Parente was a senior White House economist during the COVID-19 pandemic and worked with Thompson to keep hospitals open. ""I remember seeing the news at first and I was just shocked and when I scrolled to see it was him, I just couldn't believe it. I'm still processing,"" Parente said. ""He helped so many people. There are families that know him, who spoke of about him wonderfully, but the impact he had was in the millions."" A $10,000 reward has been offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case. The NYPD asks the public to call the Crime Stoppers hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477), or 1-888-57-PISTA (74782) for Spanish. You can also submit a tip via their website.

Slater, a native of Ireland who attended the University of Oxford and got her law degree from University College Dublin, was nominated to be assistant attorney general for the antitrust division — a powerful position in charge of all federal criminal antitrust investigations and prosecutions. “Big Tech has run wild for years, stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!” Trump said on social media. “I was proud to fight these abuses in my First Term, and our Department of Justice’s antitrust team will continue that work under Gail’s leadership.” Slater immigrated to the United States from Ireland and is a dual citizen. Since February, she has served as an economic policy adviser for Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), now the vice president-elect. She has also advised Trump’s transition team on antitrust matters. Vance is known as one of the most populist members of the Senate. Trump’s pick of Vance as his running mate further accentuates the populist shift in the party in terms of economic policy. While Republicans are typically averse to organized labor, Vance last year visited a picket line of striking autoworkers. Vance has also praised President Joe Biden’s Federal Trade Commission chairwoman, Lina Khan, who has faced opposition from conservatives in the party. Khan is a critic of big companies and a proponent of “hipster antitrust” — a school of thought that abandons the consumer welfare standard that guided U.S. antitrust policy for decades in favor of a much more adversarial approach to business that also considers other factors, such as corporate concentration and income inequality, in assessing anticompetitive practices. Slater served as a senior tech policy adviser on Trump’s first-term National Economic Council. Earlier in her career, she worked for a decade at the Federal Trade Commission, including as an adviser to a Democratic commissioner in former President Barack Obama’s administration. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Slater has also worked in the tech world herself, spending some time during the Biden administration as a vice president at Roku. She was also a senior vice president at Fox Corporation from 2019 to 2022.

309,"Trump names Massad Boulos, campaign liaison and family relative, as a senior adviser on Middle East","President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday named Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman who is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter Tiffany, as a senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Boulos arranged Trump campaign efforts to engage the Arab American community in Michigan, organizing dozens of meetings in areas with large Arab American populations angered by Democratic President Joe Biden’s backing of Israel’s offensives in Gaza and Lebanon. Trump won the majority Arab American city of Dearborn Heights on his way to sweeping Michigan and other swing states. “He has been a longtime proponent of Republican and Conservative values, an asset to my Campaign, and was instrumental in building tremendous new coalitions with the Arab American Community,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Trump and Boulos said the Republican president-elect would bring peace to the Middle East, but neither has publicly offered concrete details on Trump’s plans for the region. Boulos has previously sought office in Lebanon and has long-standing ties to political figures in the country. Other Trump picks for key national security positions are staunch supporters of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a Trump ally. Mike Huckabee, Trump’s pick for ambassador to Israel, has consistently rejected a Palestinian state in territories seized by Israel. He has claimed “there really isn’t such a thing” as Palestinians, in referring to the descendants of people who lived in Palestine before the establishment of Israel. Trump’s pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, advocated for rebuilding a biblical Jewish temple on the site of Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam’s holiest sites. Boulos helped capitalize on dissension within the Democratic base over support for the Israeli offensive in Gaza, where more than 44,000 people have died since Hamas’ attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory who don’t separate civilians and fighters in their totals. Trump won Michigan by just over 10,000 votes in 2016 and Biden retook the state for the Democrats in 2020 by roughly 154,000 votes. Trump carried Michigan in November over Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, with 49.7% of the vote. “Massad is a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East,” Trump said on Truth Social. Trump, who has long installed family members and their relatives in key positions, is signaling that he will run his second administration the same way. On Saturday, he announced that he intends to nominate real estate developer Charles Kushner, father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France.",CNBC,Center,420,"Lean Right  
The article presents a somewhat favorable view of Trump and his selection of Massad Boulos as an adviser, showcasing their attempts to connect with Arab American voters. It highlights Trump's narrative about bringing peace to the Middle East, but it also notes the controversy surrounding his and his advisers' opinions about Israel and Palestine, suggesting a balanced perspective.

34,Proud Boys Leader Testifies In Trial Of Accused Corrupt Cop,"WASHINGTON — After being transferred from prison where he is serving out a 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy, Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, the former leader of extremist group the Proud Boys, took the witness stand Thursday in the trial of a former D.C. police officer accused of disclosing insider information to him and then lying about it to investigators. Shane Lamond, once the head of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department’s intelligence division, is charged with obstruction of justice and making multiple false statements. Prosecutors say he tipped Tarrio off about a police probe into the Proud Boys and the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner on Dec. 12, 2020. Tarrio, wearing a dark green prison-issued jumpsuit and black-rimmed glasses, denied ever having a friendship with Lamond and repeatedly denied ever receiving information in advance from police about a warrant for his arrest. Instead, the former Proud Boys leader testified he was a “Twitter head,” constantly perusing social media. He claimed it was a social media post from the D.C. MPD about the banner burning that alerted him he could soon be arrested. Tarrio admitted Thursday that on Dec. 15, just days after the incident, he spoke to Lamond. But he said he never confessed to Lamond directly that he burned the banner. He wanted to do it himself and create a “circus,” in the process, he testified. “I was dead set on getting arrested ... that was my plan. I wanted to be arrested for burning the banner,” Tarrio testified. He continued: “I’m a dedicated person ... Here. I’ll be honest. I wanted to put up the circus tent. The only way to do that was to push the message out that I was about to be arrested for burning a BLM banner when so many American flags are being burned in D.C.” People needed to see the arrest was “real,” Tarrio told Lamond’s defense lawyer Mark Schamel. “And I was going to show what the Department of Justice was and I was dedicated to that cause with everything in me,” Tarrio said. Prosecutors say Lamond told Tarrio about the probe into the banner burning roughly a week after it happened and disclosed that police were weighing whether it should be charged as a hate crime. Lamond allegedly told Tarrio he would check to see if criminal investigators had footage of him burning the banner and allegedly warned Tarrio that the FBI and U.S. Secret Service were “all spun up” after the Proud Boys leader went on InfoWars. When Tarrio was on trial for seditious conspiracy, prosecutors argued the arrest, facilitated by his relationship with Lamond, ultimately ended up giving the Proud Boys leader a tidy alibi for his whereabouts on Jan. 6, 2021. When Tarrio’s cross examination started and it appeared prosecutors would ask him about Jan. 6, Tarrio refused. He wouldn’t discuss that on the stand today, he said, threatening to invoke his Fifth Amendment right. This prompted the judge to stop proceedings and call lawyers over for a private discussion at the bench. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.",Huffpost,Left,516,"Center

196,Acting Secret Service director says changes have been made since Trump assassination attempt,"The acting director of the Secret Service Director told a House panel investigating the assassination attempt against President-elect Donald Trump said the agency has already made changes to ensure the assassination attempt doesn't happen again amid a heightened threat environment. ""We are operating in a heightened threat environment with expanding protection requirements, and this requires a shift in the Secret Service's levels of protection, readiness and sustainability,"" acting Director Ronald Rowe told Congress. ""A paradigm shift focuses on elevating protection, prioritizing training, strengthening our workforce and increasing accountability."" Rowe said he is creating the Office of Field Operations ""to reset our thinking, thinking and perspective about the role field offices play in protection and to enhance our operational effectiveness by better leveraging field offices to support, enable and inform protection and protective activities."" ""The world is a dangerous place. Responsibilities of the Secret Service are critical to the national security of the United States, it is important that decision makers fully recognize and appreciate the vital role and significance of the Secret Service in our nation's security,” he said. The hearing was disrupted when Rowe got into a screaming match with Republican Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas over Rowe's attendance at the 9/11 memorial. Fallon accused Rowe of putting the president's Secret Service detail out of position so he could sit behind him during the ceremony. Before the exchange, Rowe said that the agency will use GPS blue force trackers -- a military asset that uses GPS to show where friendly and hostile assets are. He also asked Congress for more money to make sure the agency will have the preventive resources it needs and that it has already put the supplemental money to good use. ""We've also started moving money out to acquire more materials that we needed as we started to put more assets out on the road, classified assets, ballistic assets, now the wear and tear on that is going to increase,"" Rowe said. ""So now we have to make sure that we can acquire more and put more money down on contracts so that, as we are going to now go through the service life of these materials, we have to be able to replenish them and replenish them quickly. So some of these are long, lean items, so that money has been very, very helpful to us in making sure that we can address our immediate needs."" He said the agency has about 500 agents in ""various statutes of training between now and March."" The agency ""is on pace"" to hire 650 special agents and 350 uniformed division agents. Rowe said he is standing up an ""auditing capacity"" to regularly send feedback to agents to ensure they are doing the best job possible. ""We're not here to take punitive action against people, just to, you know, just to get you for something,"" he said. ""No, we want to make the mission better."" Rowe also said that he stood up a drone unit that is actively hiring, and that if there had been a counter-drone mechanism on the ground in Butler, the attempt might have been stopped. ""My goal is to get more drone operators and people with this expertise downrange in the field, so that they can go out and do this and are there on the ground, and that's going to help us fly drones and identify line of sight vulnerabilities, get that ‘eye in the sky’ perspective as we're doing our advance,"" he said. He also said he made changes like getting state and local partners on the same radio frequencies.",ABC,Lean Left,598,"Center

42,Biden Proposal Would Make Airlines Pay Travelers For Mechanical Delays,"The U.S. Department of Transportation announced Thursday it is pursuing a new rule that would force airlines to compensate passengers for long delays that are the airlines’ fault, including those caused by mechanical issues. The compensation could be at least $200 and up to $775 depending on how long the delay is. The rule could also require airlines to rebook customers for free on the next available flight and cover the cost of their meals and lodging while they’re stranded. The proposal is part of a string of reforms from President Joe Biden’s administration aimed at making airlines more accountable for consumer headaches. But because the rule is only being developed at the tail end of the Biden administration, it would be left to President-elect Donald Trump to follow through on implementing it. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg called the proposal “another step forward into a better era for commercial air travel.” “Americans know the importance of a robust airline industry, which is why this country — and U.S. taxpayers — kept U.S. airlines afloat when the COVID pandemic threatened their very existence,” Buttigieg said in a statement. “Now that we are on the other side of the pandemic and air travel is breaking records, we must continue to advance passenger protections.” The details of the rule have not been finalized, but the agency said it is considering a tiered approach to compensation: $200 to $300 for delays between three and six hours; $375 to $525 for those between six and nine; and $750 to $775 for those beyond nine. Airlines for America, a leading trade group for the U.S. airline industry, said the proposal was misguided and would drive up ticket prices. It maintains that the industry is competitive enough that it doesn’t need such mandates. “This proposal is simply one in a long string of ill-conceived and rushed rules from an administration intent on reregulating the U.S. airline industry. Four decades of real-world results show how deregulation benefits consumers,” Marli Collier, a spokesperson for the group, said in an email. The DOT said airlines currently have “no legal obligation” to inform passengers what they might be entitled to under airline policy, like reimbursement for cabs and lodging during an avoidable delay. The proposal is aimed at creating “baseline standards” for what airlines’ obligations are. In addition to covering mechanical delays, the compensation could be triggered by an “IT airline system breakdown” that snarls flights. But the agency said it’s seeking input on when to consider a delay “within an airline’s control,” unlike the weather. In 2022 and 2023, over 60% of domestic flight delays of at least three hours were the fault of the airlines, the DOT said. The Biden administration has targeted the airline industry for tighter regulation, highlighting the routine annoyances travelers face. In August, the DOT said it was pursuing a rule that would bar airlines from charging flyers extra just to sit next to their children. But as with the proposal announced Thursday, the incoming Trump administration may be able to walk back or ditch that rule altogether.",Huffpost,Left,513,"Lean Left  
The article primarily discusses a proposal from the Biden administration to hold airlines accountable for delays, indicating a consumer protection stance often associated with leftist policy priorities. It highlights the administration's efforts to improve regulations in the airline industry, showing a tilt towards supporting government intervention. The representation of the airline industry's response conveys a countering viewpoint but remains secondary to the presented consumer rights agenda. Overall, the emphasis on consumer protections aligns more closely with left-leaning ideologies."
175,A landmark climate change case will open at the top U.N. court,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The top United Nations court will take up the largest case in its history on Monday, when it opens two weeks of hearings into what countries worldwide are legally required to do to combat climate change and help vulnerable nations fight its devastating impact. After years of lobbying by island nations who fear they could simply disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice last year for an opinion on ""the obligations of States in respect of climate change."" ""We want the court to confirm that the conduct that has wrecked the climate is unlawful,"" Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, who is leading the legal team for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, told The Associated Press. In the decade up to 2023, sea levels have risen by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Vanuatu is one of a group of small states pushing for international legal intervention in the climate crisis. ""We live on the front lines of climate change impact. We are witnesses to the destruction of our lands, our livelihoods, our culture and our human rights,"" Vanuatu's climate change envoy Ralph Regenvanu told reporters ahead of the hearing. Any decision by the court would be non-binding advice and unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits. On Sunday, ahead of the hearing, advocacy groups will bring together environmental organizations from around the world. Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change — who first developed the idea of requesting an advisory opinion — together with World Youth for Climate Justice plan an afternoon of speeches, music and discussions. From Monday, the Hague-based court will hear from 99 countries and more than a dozen intergovernmental organizations over two weeks. It's the largest lineup in the institution's nearly 80-year history. Last month at the United Nations' annual climate meeting, countries cobbled together an agreement on how rich countries can support poor countries in the face of climate disasters. Wealthy countries have agreed to pool together at least $300 billion a year by 2035 but the total is short of the $1.3 trillion that experts, and threatened nations, said is needed. ""For our generation and for the Pacific Islands, the climate crisis is an existential threat. It is a matter of survival, and the world's biggest economies are not taking this crisis seriously. We need the ICJ to protect the rights of people at the front lines,"" Vishal Prasad, of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, told reporters in a briefing. Fifteen judges from around the world will seek to answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments where their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? The second question makes particular reference to ""small island developing States"" likely to be hardest hit by climate change and to ""members of ""the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change."" The judges were even briefed on the science behind rising global temperatures by the U.N.'s climate change body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ahead of the hearings. The case at the ICJ follows a number of rulings around the world ordering governments to do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In May, a U.N. tribunal on maritime law said that carbon emissions qualify as marine pollution and countries must take steps to adapt to and mitigate their adverse effects. That ruling came a month after Europe's highest human rights court said that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change, in a landmark judgment that could have implications across the continent. The ICJ's host country of The Netherlands made history when a court ruled in 2015 that protection from the potentially devastating effects of climate change is a human right and that the government has a duty to protect its citizens. The judgment was upheld in 2019 by the Dutch Supreme Court.",NPR,Lean Left,734,"Lean Left  
The article emphasizes the urgency of climate change and the need for legal actions against countries perceived as failing to protect vulnerable nations. It highlights the voice of advocacy groups and island nations, suggesting a strong alignment with progressive environmentalist viewpoints. The framing of climate change as an existential threat and the push for accountability resonate more with a left-leaning perspective, which often prioritizes social justice and environmental issues."
136,NATO Head Defends Trump To MSNBC: ‘We Have Massively … Increased Our Defense Spending’,"NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte credited President-elect Donald Trump for increased defense spending across the alliance on Wednesday.Rutte defended the president-elect during an interview on MSNBC where host Jonathan Lemire appeared to invite criticism of Trump over his relationship with NATO during his first term.“In 2018, then-President Donald Trump, at a meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels, came this close to pulling the United States out of that organization. He has repeatedly criticized NATO since then. How is the alliance preparing for his return?” Lemire asked.Rutte said that Trump was right to be critical of the organization at that time.“But, he was right in 2018 when he said that we had to spend more. And I think it is thanks to Donald Trump that NATO, if we could exclude for a second the U.S., is now at the 2% which was agreed in 2014,” Rutte said, referring to the agreement that all NATO countries spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense.Advertisement“Not a lot happened between 2014 and when Donald Trump came on board in 2016 and 2017. Since then, we have massively, on the European side, increased our defense spending. So, this is thanks to Donald Trump,” he added.CHECK OUT THE DAILY WIRE HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDEThe secretary-general was clear that the 2% target should be considered a floor, however, and encouraged NATO countries to spend “much more.”Advertisement“We need to do more. We cannot stick at 2%. It has to be much more if, long-term, we want to keep deterrence against the Russians and others,” Rutte told Lemire.The United Kingdom foreign minister, David Lammy, echoed Rutte’s comments in remarks at NATO’s headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday. Lammy was in Brussels to attend a meeting of foreign ministers of the alliance.“I think Donald Trump is right to say that the 2% was set in some ways in less challenging times and all allies right across the family should be looking beyond that 2%,” Lammy said, according to Reuters.AdvertisementThe British foreign minister said that the U.K. had set its goal for defense spending well above the 2%-of-GDP benchmark.“We’re going to 2.5%, but he’s right to challenge the alliance to come together and get beyond that,” Lammy said.Advertisement",DailyWire,Right,365,"Lean Right  
This article presents a favorable view of Donald Trump's impact on NATO defense spending. It features NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and UK Foreign Minister David Lammy endorsing Trump's previous criticisms of NATO and suggesting that his approach led to increased spending. The tone and content indicate a positive assessment of Trump’s policies, which tends to align with a right-leaning viewpoint. Additionally, the framing of criticism towards Trump's relationship with NATO as something to be defended also leans towards a right bias."
357,It’s Time for the Government to Abolish ‘Race’,"Since 1976, the U.S. Census has been forbidden by law to ask Americans about their religious identity. And yet it is allowed to ask Americans about their racial identity. To make matters worse, instead of relying on self-identification for ethnicity and race, the federal government insists that every American choose an identity from a small set of official “races” approved by. . . the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).Yes, you read that right. The bureaucracy that assigns Americans to this or that official “race” in the twenty-first-century U.S. version of the Nuremberg Laws is OMB. According to USA.gov, “The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) oversees the performance of federal agencies, and administers the federal budget.”Why is OMB given the task of formulating the number of “races” into which the American population is supposed to be divided? For the answer, we must go back to the aftermath of the civil rights revolution of the 1960s, which struck down racial segregation in employment, voting, housing, and other areas. Having outlawed Jim Crow, the civil rights movement then split into a color-blind liberal wing led by Bayard Rustin and others, who argued that the next step should be race-neutral economic reform, and a color-conscious wing, associated with black radicals, who demanded racial quotas in hiring and university admissions and black-majority congressional districts. The color-blind liberals lost the argument.Radical Chicano activists like those of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF) jumped on the racial-preferences bandwagon and argued for the recognition of a pan-Hispanic “race” whose members would be eligible for race-based affirmative action like blacks. Some “white ethnics” like Irish Americans and Italian Americans argued unsuccessfully that they, too, should be included in affirmative action, because their groups had been discriminated against by Anglo American Protestants for generations.To forestall conflicting and arbitrary racial and ethnic classifications, Caspar Weinberger, secretary of health, education, and welfare in the Nixon administration, ordered the Federal Interagency Committee on Education (FICE) to come up with a consistent system of classifying Americans by race and ethnicity. The recommendations led to OMB Statistical Policy Directive No. 15, adopted in 1977, which mandated the classification of all Americans as members of one of five official races: American Indian or Alaskan Native; Asian or Pacific Islander; Black; White; and Hispanic.Why five arbitrary pseudo-races? Why not three? Or 17? Who knows. However, in March 2024, OMB announced that the five official races of the United States will be expanded to seven, beginning with the 2030 census. “Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander” will be separated from the “Asian” category, and a new Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) category will be added.The seven official races that are scheduled to be identified in the 2030 census are as arbitrarily defined and ludicrous as the former set of five used by OMB and the Census Bureau from 1977 to 2024. Even without the inclusion of Pacific Islanders, the “Asian” category is as absurd as ever, lumping together South Asians with East Asian nationalities like Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese. Jews, Arabs, and Iranians (Iran originating from the word for “homeland of the Aryans”) will cease to be “white” for U.S. government purposes and will now be “non-whites” in the MENA category. The “white” category will continue to exclude blond, blue-eyed Paraguayans of exclusively German descent—they are “Hispanic or Latino,” you see—but will continue to include ethnicities as diverse as Portuguese and Danes.

The article critiques the government's classification of race and advocates for a color-blind society, aligning with progressive views that question current racial categorizations and their implications. It highlights historical context and presents a critical perspective on bureaucracy's role in racial identification, which resonates with left-leaning ideologies that seek to challenge systemic racism and promote inclusivity. However, the language and some arguments also indicate a critique that might lack the full embrace of radical left positions, placing it in the ""Lean Left"" category."
392,Immigration Is a Mess. Here’s How to Fix It.,"In 2018, I published Melting Pot or Civil War?, a short book on immigration. Despite its provocative title, the book offered a cautious, careful, almost hilariously mild case for immigration restriction. Having closely followed how countries around the world had handled, and more often mishandled, immigration, I laid out a road map for Making Immigration Great Again. Among other things, I called for rebalancing immigrant admissions toward the young and skilled; rejecting identitarian ideologies that undermined immigrant assimilation and sowed racial resentment; embracing labor-saving automation as an imperfect substitute for low-wage migrant labor; and investing in low-income youth. If this sounds like a boringly centrist Davos Man manifesto, I don’t disagree.Keep in mind, though, that I wrote the book in the thick of the Donald Trump–era immigration wars, when the rhetorical temperature was high and public opinion was as pro-immigration as it had ever been. Against a backdrop of family separations, attempted Muslim bans, and anxious Dreamers, it felt taboo to even suggest that Steve Bannon and friends might be half-right about the wisdom of opening our borders, especially in my small, hyper-educated, blue state–parody world.

The article presents a balanced view on immigration, acknowledging the complexities of the issue and advocating for a measured approach. It neither strongly supports nor opposes immigration but seeks to address its challenges pragmatically. The mention of a ""centrist Davos Man manifesto"" suggests a desire to appeal to a broad audience without favoring extreme positions, further reinforcing this centrist classification."
108,Optimism Among American Farmers Surges After Trump Victory,"The election of Donald Trump has sparked a wave of optimism across America’s agricultural heartland, with farmer sentiment reaching its highest level in more than three years, according to the latest Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer. According to the Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer, the overall index surged 30 points to 145 in November, driven by significant improvements in expectations for both current conditions and the long-term outlook. The Future Expectations Index jumped 37 points to 161, while the Current Conditions Index rose 18 points to 113. The combined effect propelled the barometer to its strongest level since May 2021. The survey, conducted from November 11 to 15, highlighted a sharp shift in sentiment as farmers anticipated a more favorable regulatory and tax environment under the new administration. James Mintert, director of Purdue’s Center for Commercial Agriculture, noted the election’s impact on optimism in the sector. “The post-election survey reflects a substantial change in expectations for the future,” Mintert said in the report. Improved Expectations for Regulation and Taxes The survey revealed a striking reversal in farmers’ outlook on environmental regulations. In October, 41 percent of respondents believed agricultural regulations would become more restrictive over the next five years. By November, that figure had dropped to just 9 percent, while a majority—55 percent—expected regulations to become less restrictive. This marked a significant departure from the mood surrounding the 2020 election. Farmers also reported greater stability in their expectations for tax policy. More than half of those surveyed predicted that income and estate tax rates would remain unchanged in the coming years, compared with significantly lower confidence levels in the wake of the 2020 election. Capital Investments and Financial Prospects The survey captured a growing willingness among farmers to make major investments in their operations. The Farm Capital Investment Index rose 13 points to 55, the highest reading since May 2021. Twenty-two percent of farmers said it is now a good time to make large investments, up from 15 percent in October. The shift in sentiment aligns with improved expectations for farm financial performance in 2025, as reported by the survey. One-third of respondents said they expect their operations to be in better financial shape a year from now, compared to just 19 percent in October. Optimism extended further into the future, with 52 percent of farmers saying they expect widespread good times for U.S. agriculture over the next five years, up from 34 percent the prior month. Trade Uncertainty Persists Despite the optimism, farmers remain concerned about trade risks. Forty-two percent of respondents said they believe a trade war that significantly reduces agricultural exports is “likely” or “very likely.” International trade plays a critical role in the U.S. agricultural economy, and any disruptions could temper gains from improved domestic policy conditions.",Breitbart,Right,463,"Lean Right  
The article highlights a positive narrative surrounding Donald Trump's electoral impact on American farmers. It emphasizes increased optimism, favorable regulatory expectations, and improved economic sentiments in the agriculture sector, portraying a generally supportive stance toward Republican policy outcomes. While it presents factual survey results, the framing and selective emphasis on positive developments reflect Lean Right tendencies rather than strict neutrality."
216,Here's what some of the world's most powerful people have to say about Elon Musk,"Several masters of the universe convened on Wednesday, and they had one name on their lips: Elon Musk. At the annual New York Times DealBook Summit, the world's richest man was a topic of conversation among his fellow billionaires, CEOs, and political elite. To be sure, Andrew Ross Sorkin, DealBook's founder and the day's MC, asked nearly all of his guests about Musk, who made headlines at the same summit last year for telling advertisers on X to ""go fuck"" themselves. And while the Tesla CEO wasn't present this year, many conversations touched on his latest role. Over the past couple of months, Musk has become a political advisor and confidant to President-elect Donald Trump, and he was one of Trump's biggest donors, shelling out about $119 million to support his campaign. The reaction to Musk's new role as co-leader of the Department of Government Efficiency ranged from cautiously optimistic to not giving a damn. Ken Griffin, the billionaire hedge-fund manager and GOP donor, praised Musk's entrepreneurial ability. ""He runs Tesla, he runs SpaceX at a level of excellence that very few companies can even start to relate to,"" Griffin said. At the same time, he questioned just how much Musk could impact federal spending. ""He's going to have to hit the hard reality, the hard truth, that making cuts of any form whatsoever will be politically very unpopular,"" Griffin said. ""It'll be very hard to squeeze numbers in the trillions of dollars out of the baseline budget."" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who has been embroiled in a personal and legal feud with Musk, similarly praised the Tesla CEO's business acumen. ""At a time when most of the world was not thinking very ambitiously, he pushed a lot of people, me included, to think much more ambitiously,"" Altman said of his OpenAI cofounder. While Altman said his feelings about Musk had changed, he added that it would be unlike his former ""mega hero"" to use his political proximity for his own monetary gain. ""It would be profoundly un-American to use political power, to the degree that Elon has it, to hurt your competitors and advantage your own businesses,"" Altman said. ""It would go so deeply against the values I believe he holds very dear to himself."" Jeff Bezos, whose Blue Origin is in direct competition with Musk's SpaceX, agreed that Musk's relationship with Trump wasn't that concerning. ""I take it face value what has been said, which is that he is not going to use his political power to advantage his own companies or to disadvantage his competitors,"" Bezos said. ""Let's go into it hoping that the statements that have been made are correct, that this is going to be done above board in the public interest."" And Sundar Pichai, the Alphabet CEO, said Musk's xAI artificial-intelligence company was a formidable competitor ""given Elon's track record."" Those interviewed with political experience — the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, and former President Bill Clinton — appeared the most unfazed by Musk's new position of power. Powell seemed confident in the independence of the Fed, even though Musk has signaled support for moving the central bank under the president's command. And Clinton seemed to almost entirely brush off Musk's burgeoning influence — including the fact he was on a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""Trump's whole shtick is that all these rules and systems don't amount to anything,"" the former president said. ""Being the richest guy on Earth is far more important than anything else that you could be to him,"" Clinton added. ""That's what he values. It's no big deal.""",BusinessInsider,Lean Left,605,"Center  
The article presents a balanced view of Elon Musk's influence in politics and business, featuring a range of opinions from various high-profile individuals without taking a clear stance. It includes critical perspectives, as well as praises for Musk's entrepreneurial skills. The mention of both support and skepticism from different figures provides a comprehensive look at the topic, aligning it with centrist reporting rather than a lean towards either side of the political spectrum."
334,Congressional Panel Concludes Covid Likely Came from Wuhan Lab,"The congressional panel tasked with investigating the Covid-19 pandemic concluded in a report released Monday that the virus most likely originated from a lab leak in Wuhan, China. The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic’s 500-page final report details its two-year investigation into the pandemic’s origins and the government response. “The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted a distrust in leadership. Trust is earned. Accountability, transparency, honesty, and integrity will regain this trust. A future pandemic requires a whole of America response managed by those without personal benefit or bias. We can always do better, and for the sake of future generations of Americans, we must. It can be done,” said Representative Brad Wenstrup (R., Ohio), chairman of the subcommittee. The Covid panel determined that the pandemic probably originated in a lab because of the virus’s biological characteristics, particularly the speed with which it infected humans, and the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts to obstruct investigations into the virus’s origins. Furthermore, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the lab in Wuhan, China, conducted risky coronavirus experiments at low safety levels and had researchers come down with a virus similar to Covid-19 months before the pandemic began. At the start of the pandemic, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci orchestrated the “proximal origin” paper published in Nature to discredit early proponents of the lab-leak theory. The paper was published in March 2020 after Fauci and several co-authors of the paper had discussions about the plausibility of a lab leak and the purpose of the “proximal origin” paper. In large part because of the paper, social-media platforms censored content related to the lab-leak and the theory was entirely dismissed in mainstream media as the pandemic spread around the world. Fauci and then-National Institutes of Health director Dr. Francis Collins, another top official involved in the “proximal origin” paper, later testified to the subcommittee that the lab leak is not a conspiracy theory. To compile the report, the covid subcommittee reviewed one million pages of documents and held dozens of hearings and transcribed interviews with witnesses. It marks the most sweeping investigation into the pandemic to date and the negative long-term impacts of the measures public-health officials used to attempt to slow down the disease’s spread. The subcommittee also discovered that the Justice Department empaneled a grand jury to investigate Covid-19 origins and it appears to have involved EcoHealth Alliance, the nonprofit responsible for overseeing risky, taxpayer funded coronavirus research in the Wuhan lab. The Justice Department declined to comment. EcoHealth Alliance did not respond to a request for comment. EcoHealth Alliance and its president Dr. Peter Daszak featured prominently in the subcommittee report because of the organization’s malfeasance surrounding the gain-of-function experiments it facilitated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. EcoHealth’s failures include the gain-of-function experiments, submitting a progress report two years late, failing to report a dangerous experiment, and misleading NIH on the locations of samples, according to the subcommittee report. The subcommittee also accuses EcoHealth president Dr. Peter Daszak of obstruction, making false statements to Congress, and receiving internal NIH information from NIAID senior official Dr. David Morens, who used his private email to communicate with Daszak. Additionally, Morens helped Daszak avoid National Institutes of Health oversight of his research grant and edited letters Daszak sent to the NIH. Daszak has strenuously denied that EcoHealth facilitated gain-of-function research and dismissed concerns about its apparent lack of transparency about the experiments at the Wuhan lab. Morens seems to have evaded federal records laws by using his personal email account and received assistance from a NIH freedom of information act (FOIA) official in doing so. The FOIA official invoked her Fifth Amendment rights when the subcommittee compelled her to testify. The subcommittee determined that Morens appears to have made false statements to the subcommittee about the actions he took to evade FOIA requests and his deletion of emails from his government account. Morens also falsely told the subcommittee that he did not assist Daszak with communications to NIH and falsely claimed he only had two email accounts, his work email and personal Gmail, according to the subcommittee report. Many of the details of EcoHealth’s actions were previously publicized by the subcommittee in letters and hearings, resulting in the U.S. government initiating debarment proceedings against the organization and Daszak himself. EcoHealth and Daszak are currently suspended from receiving taxpayer funds, a status that could become permanent when the debarment proceedings are finalized.

1,'Cozying up to dictators': Intel experts sound alarm about 'historically unfit' Tulsi Gabbard,"During the Cold War, countless Republicans were — along with Democrats — blistering critics of the Kremlin. But the MAGA movement has had its share of Republicans who aren't shy about defending Russian President Vladimir Putin. The late conservative Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) considered Donald Trump a ""disgraceful"" Putin apologist. And Putin's vocal MAGA defenders have included former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and ex-Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who spent much of her political career as a Democrat but is now a far-right MAGA Republican. Trump has nominated Gabbard for national intelligence director, but it remains to be seen whether or not she will be confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2025.

""Within Washington foreign policy circles and the tightly knit intelligence community,"" The Guardian explains, ""Gabbard has long been seen as dangerous. Some have worried that she seems inclined toward conspiracy theories and cozying up to dictators. Others, including the former secretary of state and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, have gone further, calling her a 'Russian asset.'"" The Guardian adds, ""Those concerns have been heightened by Gabbard's nomination under Donald Trump to the post of director of national intelligence, a senior cabinet-level position with access to classified materials from across the 18 U.S. intelligence agencies, and shaping that information for the president’s daily briefing. The role would allow her to access and declassify information at her discretion, and also direct some intelligence-sharing with U.S. allies around the world.""

234,President Joe Biden Pardons His Son Hunter After Previously Saying He Wouldn’t,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden pardoned his son, Hunter, sparing the younger Biden a possible prison sentence for federal felony gun and tax convictions and reversing his past promises not to use the extraordinary powers of the presidency for the benefit of his family. The Democratic President had previously said he would not pardon his son or commute his sentence after convictions in the two cases in Delaware and California. The move on Sunday night comes weeks before Hunter Biden was set to receive his punishment after his trial conviction in the gun case and guilty plea on tax charges, and less than two months before President-elect Donald Trump is set to return to the White House. It caps a long-running legal saga for the younger Biden, who publicly disclosed he was under federal investigation in December 2020—a month after his father’s 2020 victory—and casts a pall over the elder Biden’s legacy. Biden, who time and again pledged to Americans that he would restore norms and respect for the rule of law after Trump’s first term in office, ultimately used his position to help his son, breaking his public pledge to Americans that he would do no such thing. Read More: 6 Reasons Why Joe Biden Pardoned Hunter Biden In a statement released Sunday evening, Biden said, “I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.” The President’s sweeping pardon covers not just the gun and tax offenses against the younger Biden, but also any other “offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024.” In June, Biden categorically ruled out a pardon or commutation for his son, telling reporters as his son faced trial in the Delaware gun case, “I abide by the jury decision. I will do that and I will not pardon him.” As recently as Nov. 8, days after Trump’s victory, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre ruled out a pardon or clemency for the younger Biden, saying, “We’ve been asked that question multiple times. Our answer stands, which is no.” The elder Biden has publicly stood by his only living son as Hunter descended into serious drug addiction and threw his family life into turmoil before getting back on track in recent years. The President’s political rivals have long used Hunter Biden’s myriad mistakes as a political cudgel against his father: In one hearing, lawmakers displayed photos of the drug-addled President’s son half-naked in a seedy hotel. House Republicans also sought to use the younger Biden’s years of questionable overseas business ventures in a since-abandoned attempt to impeach his father, who has long denied involvement in his son’s dealings or benefiting from them in any way. “The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,” Biden said in his statement. “No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son.” “I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,” Biden added, claiming he made the decision this weekend. The President had spent the Thanksgiving holiday in Nantucket, Massachusetts, with Hunter and his family, and departed for Angola later Sunday on what may be his last foreign trip as President before leaving office on Jan. 20, 2025. Hunter Biden was convicted in June in Delaware federal court of three felonies for purchasing a gun in 2018 when, prosecutors said, he lied on a federal form by claiming he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs. He had been set to stand trial in September in the California case accusing him of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes. But he agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor and felony charges in a surprise move hours after jury selection was set to begin. David Weiss, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware who negotiated the plea deal, was subsequently named a special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to have more autonomy over the prosecution of the President’s son. Hunter Biden said he was pleading guilty in that case to spare his family more pain and embarrassment after the gun trial aired salacious details about his struggles with a crack cocaine addiction. The tax charges carry up to 17 years behind bars and the gun charges are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though federal sentencing guidelines were expected to call for far less time and it was possible he would have avoided prison time entirely. Hunter Biden was supposed to be sentenced this month in the two federal cases, which the special counsel brought after a plea deal with prosecutors that likely would have spared him prison time fell apart under scrutiny by a judge. Under the original deal, Hunter was supposed to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses and and would have avoided prosecution in the gun case as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years. But the plea hearing quickly unraveled last year when the judge raised concerns about unusual aspects of the deal. The younger Biden was subsequently indicted in the two cases. Hunter Biden’s legal team this weekend released a 52-page white paper titled “The political prosecutions of Hunter Biden,” describing the President’s son as a “surrogate to attack and injure his father, both as a candidate in 2020 and later as President.” The younger Biden’s lawyers have long argued that prosecutors bowed to political pressure to indict the President’s son amid heavy criticism by Trump and other Republicans of what they called the “sweetheart” plea deal. Rep. James Comer, one of the Republican chairmen leading congressional investigations into Biden’s family, blasted the President’s pardon, saying that the evidence against Hunter was “just the tip of the iceberg.” “It’s unfortunate that, rather than come clean about their decades of wrongdoing, President Biden and his family continue to do everything they can to avoid accountability,” Comer said on X, the website formerly known as Twitter. Biden is hardly the first President to deploy his pardon powers to benefit those close to him. In his final weeks in office, Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in law, Jared Kushner, as well as multiple allies convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Trump over the weekend announced plans to nominate the elder Kushner to be the U.S. envoy to France in his next administration. Read More: Here Are the New Members of Trump’s Administration So Far Trump, who has pledged to dramatically overhaul and install loyalists across the Justice Department after he was prosecuted for his role in trying to subvert the 2020 presidential election, said in a social media post on Sunday that Hunter Biden’s pardon was “such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice.” “Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?” Trump asked, referring to those convicted in the violent Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol by his supporters. Hunter Biden said in an emailed statement that he will never take for granted the relief granted to him and vowed to devote the life he has rebuilt “to helping those who are still sick and suffering.” “I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction—mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport,” the younger Biden said. Hunter Biden’s legal team filed Sunday night in both Los Angeles and Delaware asking the judges handling his gun and tax cases to immediately dismiss them, citing the pardon. A spokesperson for Weiss did not respond to messages seeking comment Sunday night. NBC News was first to report Biden was expected to pardon his son Sunday. —Associated Press writer Josh Boak in Nantucket, Massachusetts, contributed to this report.",TIME,Lean Left,1359,"Lean Left  
The article presents a narrative that leans more favorably toward President Biden by focusing on his familial responsibility and portraying the legal challenges faced by Hunter Biden as politically motivated. However, it also addresses criticisms from political opponents, which adds a layer of balance. The language seems to empathize with the Biden family while highlighting controversies, suggesting a slight lean toward a more sympathetic view of the democratic perspective."
349,"Trump Picks Crypto Advocate to Run SEC, Brings Back Peter Navarro for Top Trade Position","President-elect Donald Trump is appointing a strong proponent of cryptocurrency to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, a major victory for an industry that made serious inroads with Trump during his presidential campaign. Trump announced Wednesday that Wall Street veteran and crypto champion Paul Atkins will oversee the agency tasked with regulating financial markets. “Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations. He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,” Trump said on Truth Social. Atkins is CEO of consulting firm Patomak Global Partners and was previously an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush. Atkins will be replacing outgoing SEC chairman Gary Gensler, who the crypto sector considers a villain because of his attempts to impose greater regulations on digital securities. The nomination of Atkins is consistent with the deregulatory crypto agenda Trump campaigned on. Trump’s sons, Don Jr., Eric, and Barron, have gotten involved in the crypto industry and pushed their father to take a softer approach to digital securities. Atkins was one of several cabinet nominations Trump announced Wednesday for a variety of legal and policy roles. Trump is naming recently imprisoned former aide Peter Navarro to a senior advisory role on trade and manufacturing policy. “I am pleased to announce that Peter Navarro, a man who was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it, will serve as my Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing,” Trump announced on Truth Social. Trump credited Navarro for helping his previous administration renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and implement his slate of tariffs. As senior counselor, Trump said Navarro is going to help “successfully advance and communicate the Trump Manufacturing, Tariff, and Trade Agendas,” a major component of the economic agenda Trump campaigned on. In the first Trump administration, Navarro was an advocate for protectionist trade policies as director of the office of trade and manufacturing policy, an office Trump established through executive order. Navarro is a Harvard educated economist whose views on trade have been considered outside of the academic mainstream. Navarro spent four months in prison earlier this year on contempt of congress charges for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House select committee on the January 6th Capitol riot. He spoke about the case against him at the Republican National Convention in July, which turned him into a martyr among the MAGA faithful. Navarro has promoted false theories about purported voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and pushed for Republican lawmakers to contest the election results. Trump has already threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on goods coming in from Canada and Mexico unless America’s neighbors do more to help stem the tide of illegal immigration. He also floated a 10 percent increase in China tariffs to punish China for failing to prevent the flow of fentanyl into Mexico and across the southern border. Not long after those threats, Trump had friendly conversations with Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, who visited the president-elect at his Mar-a-Lago club. Trump said last week that Sheinbaum agreed to shut down the flow of illegal migrants across the border and take further action to fight drug trafficking.

246,South Korean president says he will lift martial law after parliament rejects his declaration,"South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared he would lift emergency martial law early Wednesday morning. The declaration came hours after the National Assembly voted to overturn the president’s decree issued late Tuesday night amid mounting protests and backlash from lawmakers. Yoon said he has called for a Cabinet meeting to officially lift martial law, as per the Constitution. The military units that were deployed have also been withdrawn, Yoon announced. “I will immediately convene a Cabinet meeting to accept the National Assembly’s request and end martial law,” Yoon said. In his announcement which came around 4 a.m. local time, Yoon also called for parliamentary lawmakers to “immediately cease its reckless actions that paralyze the functions of the state, including repeated impeachment attempts, legislative manipulation and budget manipulation.” In recent weeks, Yoon and the opposition Democratic Party, which holds the parliamentary majority, were in a political deadlock over next year’s budget plan. Opposition lawmakers had also called to impeach several Cabinet members after several corruption and graft scandals. Earlier in the night, the National Assembly had been barricaded by soldiers and police officers, blocking protesters and lawmakers from entering. But within three hours of Yoon’s surprise martial law decree, 190 out of the 300 National Assembly lawmakers — including members of Yoon’s People Power Party — gathered to overturn the emergency order. Under the country’s constitution, the president is required to comply with the National Assembly’s vote. The shock move to enact martial law marked the first time in more than 40 years such a decision was declared in South Korea, a key Asian democracy and economic power. Yoon had accused opposition lawmakers of throwing the country into a political crisis. Under the martial law declaration, all political activities and acts that “incite social disorder” are prohibited. “I declare martial law to protect the free Republic of Korea from the threat of North Korean communist forces, to eradicate the despicable pro-North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people, and to protect the free constitutional order,” Yoon said. However, Yoon’s martial law decree came as a surprise even to members of his party. The party’s chair, Han Dong-hoon, and Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon both voiced their opposition to Yoon’s martial law declaration on Tuesday night. Choo Kyung-ho, who is the leader of the People Power Party in the National Assembly, stated that he learned of the martial law declaration through the news. Yoon, who was elected in 2022, had seen his approval ratings fall below 20% in recent weeks. Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung earlier in the night cited concerns on the martial law declaration’s effect on the economy. “The economy of Republic of Korea will collapse irretrievably, international trust will fall and foreign investors will withdraw,” Lee said in a livestream earlier in the night on his way to the National Assembly. The declaration roiled Korean markets. The won fell sharply against the dollar and earlier dropped 1% before paring some of its declines to trade around 1,418 won. The iShares MSCI South Korea ETF (EWY), which tracks Korean stocks fell about 1.6%. After the National Assembly vote, the Bank of Korea’s Monetary Policy Board announced it would hold an emergency meeting to discuss market stabilization measures for the following day. The stock market will open as normal at 9 a.m. KST, the Korea Exchange announced on Wednesday morning. The U.S. was not previously informed of Yoon’s martial law decision. At a separate event, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell underscored the “ironclad” U.S. alliance with South Korea. “We stand by Korea in their time of uncertainty,” said Campbell.",CNBC,Center,606,"Center

366,House GOP twice blocks release of potentially damning Gaetz ethics report,"House Republicans twice blocked the release of a potentially damning report from the House Committee on Ethics about former Rep. Matt Gaetz on Thursday, burying sexual misconduct and drug abuse allegations that had in part derailed his push to be confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump’s attorney general. In rapid fire deliberations, the House in near party-line votes of 206-198 and 204-198 moved the matter back to the purview of the Ethics panel. Rep. Tom McClintock of California was the lone Republican to cross the aisle and double down in voting with Democrats to open the scandal to the public. Reps. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) and Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) introduced the dueling measures Tuesday as privileged resolutions, which require a vote within two legislative days. Casten’s demanded the release of the report, while Cohen’s required both the release and preservation of documents. “Resigning from Congress should not allow Members to avoid accountability for allegations as serious as those faced by Matt Gaetz. The Ethics Committee has often released reports on former Members,” Casten argued in defense of his resolution. 3 Matt Gaetz resigned form Congress and has denied wrongdoing.

Ultimately, Gaetz dropped out of the running not long after it became clear he faced an uphill Senate confirmation process. Trump then announced former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R) as his pick for the role. Prior to Congress’ break for Thanksgiving, the Ethics Committee met for a vote but opted against releasing the report despite the complaints of Democratic members of the bipartisan panel. While the panel did not confirm what they were voting on, its Chairman Michael Guest (R-Miss.) and ranking member Susan Wild (D-Pa.) dropped strong hints they were mulling the potential release of the report. The House Committee on Ethics met again prior to the vote on Casten’s resolution Thursday but did not release the report or disclose specific details of the meeting. 3 Sean Casten had introduced the resolution prior to Thanksgiving but opted to reintroduce it Tuesday to force the vote. Bloomberg via Getty Images House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) had publicly opposed the release of the report and after Gaetz dropped out of consideration for the AG post, momentum to do so seemingly lost steam. Witnesses had allegedly come forward to the committee with accusations that Gaetz paid for sex with two women and had sex with a then-17-year-old over seven years ago, according to multiple attorneys. Gaetz has strenuously denied wrongdoing. He had roiled many of his Republican and Democratic colleagues in Congress alike last year by spearheading the effort to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) Accusers had alleged that Gaetz sent Venmo payments in exchange for sex. The intercourse with the then-minor allegedly took place at a party in July 2017. One of the accusers claimed to have witnessed Gaetz in flagrante delicto with the minor, according to Orlando-based attorney Joel Leppard, who represents the two accusers who weren’t minors at the time. Leppard indicated that the witness said “her understanding was that Matt Gaetz did not know that [the 17-year-old] was a minor, and that when he learned that she was a minor, that he broke off things and did not continue a sexual relationship until she turned 18,” ABC News reported. The Justice Department had investigated the claims against Gaetz but ultimately declined to press charges against him. 3 Steve Cohen argued there needs to be more transparency on former Rep. Matt Gaetz. AP 46What do you think? Post a comment. Typically, the ethics panel does not release reports on former members, but Cohen and Casten both cited exceptions in their resolutions and were adamant that the situation warranted it.

The article focuses on the actions of House Republicans to block the release of an ethics report regarding Matt Gaetz, highlighting the party-line nature of the votes and presenting allegations of serious misconduct. It frames the blocking as a lack of accountability, which leans toward a more critical view of Republican actions. The inclusion of Democratic voices advocating for transparency further emphasizes a narrative that appears to align more with left-leaning perspectives on ethics and accountability in government."
294,Trump chooses U.S. Covid policy critic Bhattacharya to lead NIH,"President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday chose Stanford academic and U.S. Covid policy critic Jay Bhattacharya to run the National Institutes of Health, the country’s top public funder of medical research with a budget of some $47.3 billion. The NIH has been in the crosshairs of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. The NIH director oversees 27 institutes and centers that conduct early stage research on everything from vaccines for emerging pandemic threats to targets for new drugs. Just days before his nomination as HHS secretary, RFK Jr. said he would act quickly to fire 600 people at the NIH and replace them all with new hires. The agency employs nearly 20,000 people. In addition to job cuts, Kennedy has said he aims to shift NIH’s focus from infectious diseases such as Covid-19, to tackling potential cures for chronic diseases, such as diabetes. Bhattacharya, a Stanford health policy professor and doctor, was an outspoken critic of the U.S. government’s Covid-19 policies during the pandemic. Along with two other academics, he published the Great Barrington Declaration in October 2020, which called for a return to life as normal for those who were not vulnerable to the virus. He sued the government afterward, alleging that it pressured social media platforms to censor his opinions. Bhattacharya graduated from Stanford University School of Medicine in 1997 and received his doctorate from Stanford’s Department of Economics in 2000, according to his resume. During the Covid pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease who served on President Trump’s coronavirus task force, became a frequent target of Republicans for contradicting some of Trump’s coronavirus policies and recommendations, leading to calls for his dismissal. Francis Collins, the NIH director and Fauci’s boss, defended Fauci in a July 2020 interview with STAT News, saying it was “unimaginable” to consider firing Fauci, as some Republicans had demanded. As a career federal employee, Fauci’s job was shielded from political firings by federal civil service regulations, protections Trump has vowed to undo.",CNBC,Center,350,"Lean Right  
The article discusses Trump's appointment of Jay Bhattacharya, a critic of U.S. Covid policy, to lead the NIH, aligning with a perspective favorable to Trump's decisions. It emphasizes the contentious nature of the selection, with references to leading Republicans and their criticisms of Covid policies. While it provides factual information, the overall tone suggests sympathy towards a right-leaning position on health policy and governance. The discussion of efforts to fire Fauci and replace staff at NIH further illustrates a lean towards right-wing views on government intervention in health matters."
395,"Senate Democrats Warm to Trump’s Labor Secretary Pick, Welcoming Her Pro-Union Record","In many ways, Donald Trump’s Labor secretary nominee — first-term Representative Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R., Ore.) – is the best pick Democrats could realistically hope for from a Republican president-elect: the daughter of a Teamster with a pro-organized labor legislative record and an astonishing amount of support from union leaders. “She seems to be an incredibly strong, pro-labor choice,” Senator John Fetterman (D., Pa.) told National Review of Chavez-DeRemer, who recently lost reelection to her Oregon House seat. He added that her nomination is a “strategic” and “smart play” for Trump, because it may help the GOP “co-opt” even more support from traditionally Democratic union voters in the future. Progressive Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) also signaled openness to supporting her nomination earlier this week. “If Chavez-DeRemer commits as labor secretary to strengthen labor unions and promote worker power, she’s a strong candidate for the job,” she said in a statement, cautioning that she serves as an “early test” of whether the president-elect will “stand strong with workers or bow down to his corporate donors and the Republican establishment’s opposition.” Congressional Democrats and unions are particularly enamored with her support for the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would strip 27 states of their right-to-work laws and heavily regulate independent contracting law. This could prove toxic among some Senate Republicans, most of whom hail from right-to-work states and oppose the PRO Act. The National Right to Work Committee is lobbying Senate Republicans against her. She may also run into trouble with Republicans over her support for the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, which would require state and local government employers to collectively bargain, as well as her decision earlier this year to skip a vote on a GOP-led effort to block a Biden-era Labor Department rule that heavily restricts worker classification rights for independent contractors. The same record that appears to be winning over some Senate Democrats is giving Republicans pause. Before she gets a hearing, Chavez-DeRemer must first make it through the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee under the leadership of soon-to-be Chairman Bill Cassidy (R., La.), who signaled in a November 22 statement he has many questions about her pro-union record. “I will need to get a better understanding of her support for Democrat legislation in Congress that would strip Louisiana’s ability to be a right to work state, and if that will be her position going forward.” Speaking with reporters in the U.S. Capitol Tuesday afternoon, HELP Committee member and Senator Tommy Tuberville (R., Ala.) joked that he’s gotten a lot of calls to his office opposing her nomination and that she “checks all the boxes for the left, not many for the right.” And he predicted that Democrats’ early openness to her nomination could pad her margins if she racks up some opposition from Republicans. Next year, Senate Republicans will have 53 seats, and every nominee will need a simple majority to get confirmed. Vice-President-elect J. D. Vance can break a tie. “She might get more votes than anybody, because she is one of them,” Tuberville said, citing her pro-union record and support for the PRO Act. He said he looks forward to meeting with her privately, adding he plans to “give President Trump the benefit of the doubt here because he nominated her and there’s got to be a reason.” But Republicans worry that her support among union leaders is a red flag. Teamsters President Sean O’Brien privately lobbied for Chavez-DeRemer in the lead-up to Trump’s announcement, according to press reports, and later praised Trump for “putting American workers first” by nominating her. GOP bogeywoman Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, also had kind words for Chavez-DeRemer the day of her nomination, writing on social media that “her record suggests real support of workers and their right to unionize.” “We haven’t gone through our own deep dive,” said HELP Committee member and Senator John Hickenlooper (D., Colo.). “Certainly, I’m looking forward to being able to ask her questions and see what her vision is,” he said, adding that “President Trump’s nominations have surprised many people in both directions.” Democratic Senator and HELP Committee member Tina Smith (D., Minn.) sounded a similar tune, telling NR Tuesday afternoon that she’s “very open to learning more about her.” GOP Senator Josh Hawley (R., Mo.), whose record is more pro-organized labor than most Senate Republicans, said he looks forward to meeting her and supporting her nomination. “I tend to think she’s a great choice,” Hawley told NR on Tuesday. Pressed about whether he plans to have conversations with his Senate GOP colleagues who may have reservations about her record, he said he plans to tell them to “relax” and “take some deep breaths” before rushing to oppose her. “It’s all going to be fine,” he said. “Donald Trump ran on a pro-worker platform. So, I think it’s a good sign that he’s delivering on that.” Correction: This article originally misstated Chavez-DeRemer’s party affiliation.

The article presents a balanced perspective by highlighting both the support and concerns regarding Lori Chavez-DeRemer’s nomination as Labor Secretary. It includes quotes from various political figures across party lines, reflecting a diversity of opinions.

Will Joe Biden pardon Donald Trump before leaving office?UnmuteLoading Ad 00:00/03:03 LIVE Rep. Anthony D’Esposito (R-NY) is pitching himself as President-elect Donald Trump’s second choice to head the country’s top federal agency for combating drug trafficking and distribution. On Saturday evening, Trump nominated Florida Sheriff Chad Chronister to head the Drug Enforcement Administration during his second term. However, Chronister withdrew his name from consideration for the post on Tuesday, leaving the position open for another candidate. D’Esposito, who represented New York’s 4th Congressional District for just one term before losing his bid for reelection earlier this month, emerged Wednesday as a top contender to become Trump’s next DEA chief. The New York Republican is actively lobbying the Trump team for the position and has been “making calls” to get his name “to the top” of consideration, a source familiar with the matter told the Washington Examiner. D’Esposito first rose to power during the 2022 elections when he beat Rep.-elect Laura Gillen (D-NY), flipping the New York seat red. Rep. Anthony D’Esposito (R-NY) arrives for a meeting of Republicans on Capitol Hill in Washington, Oct. 24, 2023. D’Esposito is the Republican candidate in New York’s 4th District. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) He became embroiled in controversy this summer after revelations he hired his ex-mistress and fiancee’s daughter to work in a state district office. The congressman paid the two women roughly $29,000 in taxpayer funds during their employment, leading to concerns he may have violated ethics rules. D’Esposito vehemently denied any allegations of impropriety. He campaigned against Gillen for a second rematch this fall during his first race as an incumbent. Ultimately losing his battle for reelection battle by a narrow margin, the opening at the DEA during a second Trump term could spell a political comeback for the single-term lawmaker. D’Esposito could face a weightier vetting process from the Trump camp than the initial DEA pick, Chronister, received. Although Chronister said he pulled out of the DEA battle of his own volition, a statement from Trump on Wednesday begged to differ. The president-elect appeared to be angry over strict lockdown measures the Florida sheriff had enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic that rose to the surface again after he was nominated to head the health agency. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Chronister authorized the arrest of a Florida pastor named Dr. Rodney Howard-Browne during the pandemic for violating his safety standards. “He didn’t pull out; I pulled him out because I did not like what he said to my pastors and other supporters,” Trump said of Chronister.

The article discusses Rep. Anthony D’Esposito's bid for the DEA chief position, focusing on his ties to Trump and the Republican Party. Language such as ""flipping the New York seat red"" and details emphasizing D’Esposito's Republican affiliation contribute to a positive framing of conservative politics. Additionally, it maintains a relatively neutral tone, avoiding overtly critical commentary about Republicans while mentioning controversies in a way that centers on political maneuvering rather than ethical implications.

362,"The Tulsi Gabbard Smears Are Unfounded, Unfair, and Unhelpful","If one read only the legacy press and listened to Democrats, one would think that president-elect Donald Trump has just nominated a Kremlin stooge to oversee America’s intelligence community.Trump’s choice to be his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman, has been tarred as “likely a Russian asset” by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL). The New York Times last week devoted a feature-length story to how Gabbard has become a “favorite of Russia’s state media.” Hillary Clinton once claimed Moscow was “grooming” her to run for president. Former congressman Adam Kinzinger, writing in The Bulwark, called her “outright disloyal.” Gabbard certainly has very different views than Clinton and Kinzinger on foreign policy and the intelligence community. But her neutrality on Ukraine’s war for survival and her openness to diplomacy with despots also places her out of step with the mainstream of the Republican majority (not to mention most Democrats) in the Senate. She will have some explaining to do in her nomination hearing.I happen to think Gabbard is far too credulous when it comes to some of the world’s most despicable tyrants. Her past remarks about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine were horrendous. Consider her video message from February 27, 2022, three days after Russia unilaterally invaded Ukraine. “It’s time to put geopolitics aside and embrace the spirit of aloha, respect and love, for the Ukrainian people by coming to an agreement that Ukraine will be a neutral country.”She uttered those words when Ukraine was at risk of extinguishment by the Russian army. There was no room for both sides at that moment. The Ukrainians were the victims; the Russians were the aggressors. And yet Gabbard believed Russia should be rewarded by preemptively closing off Ukraine’s prospect of joining NATO’s defensive alliance, even after the country had historically been invaded and starved by its powerful neighbor.

352,Biden Faces Mounting Criticism from Dem Senators over Pardoning Hunter,"The trickle of intraparty criticism over President Joe Biden’s decision to pardon his son Hunter increased throughout the day on Monday, as a growing chorus of congressional Democrats returned to Washington and laid into the president for going back on his word after spending more than a year insisting that the pardon was not on the table. “He said he wouldn’t do it. He shouldn’t have broken his promise,” Senator Tim Kaine (D., Va) told National Review Monday evening a few hours after he issued a statement criticizing Biden’s decision. Most Democrats who are frustrated by the president’s pardon — which came days before his son’s sentencing for a federal gun conviction and a tax-evasion guilty plea — acknowledged the difficulty and pain that came with Hunter’s addiction to crack cocaine. “Anybody who’s got kids knows what a tragedy it is to have a child that’s addicted for year after year on drugs,” Senator John Hickenlooper (D., Colo.) told NR Monday evening. “They literally lose their ability to make responsible decisions, and I recognize that President Biden felt that his son was prosecuted unfairly, way beyond what would have normally been justified.” “But,” Hickenlooper added, “we are a country of law, and he was tried by his peers.” There’s no shortage of congressional Democrats who have continued to stay mum on the matter since Biden’s announcement Sunday evening, and a number of Senate Democrats on Capitol Hill Monday evening staunchly defended the president’s decision. And yet with Biden’s presidency coming to an end, a significant number of congressional Democrats clearly feel that they have little political capital to lose when criticizing the lame-duck octogenarian during his final days atop the party hierarchy. The outgoing president’s sweeping pardon immunizes the younger Biden for any offenses he “may have committed or taken part in” over an eleven-year period. And it comes less than two months before his predecessor, Donald Trump, returns to the White House with plans to potentially pardon those imprisoned for participating in the January 6th Capitol riot. The pardon’s time period of January 1, 2014, to December 1, 2024, includes the entirety of Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings as well as the tax and gun charges that special counsel David Weiss prosecuted him for. The scope of the pardon has some Democrats worried about the precedent that will be set for future commanders in chief — namely the president-elect. Elaborating on his Monday-morning statement that Biden’s pardon puts “personal interest ahead of duty” and undermines Americans’ faith in the justice system, Senator Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) said that Biden’s decision sets a “lousy precedent” for future presidents, especially as Trump is “on his way to town.” Some Senate Democrats defended Joe Biden’s move to pardon his son, with Senator Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) accusing Trump of politicizing the FBI. “Given the extent to which Donald Trump is politicizing the FBI, I think it’s understandable,” Wyden told reporters. Trump announced Saturday that he has chosen MAGA hardliner Kash Patel to run the FBI and clean house at the bureau. “This decision must have been a deeply personal one,” Senator Richard Blumenthal told National Review, calling the move “an exercise of discretion that is accorded to the president under the Constitution.” He added that it’s “his alone to make to his son.” Senator Raphael Warnock (D., Ga.) told NR that “it’s within the realm of the president’s authority, and that’s been the case for a very long time.” Right after the pardon, numerous Republican lawmakers were quick to lambast Joe Biden for reversing his promise and said it was part of a larger pattern of behavior from the Biden family. According to NBC News, it was Joe Biden’s plan to publicly state he would not pardon his son, while keeping the option on the table privately. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre insisted Monday that Joe Biden “came to the decision this weekend.” She subsequently took to X to deny NBC’s reporting and reiterate her statements.

The article focuses on criticism from Democratic senators toward President Biden regarding his decision to pardon his son, highlighting internal party discord and moral concerns about the implications of the pardon. Although it features some supportive voices from within the party, the overall tone and emphasis on criticism suggest a tendency to illuminate flaws in Biden's decisions, which aligns with a lean towards left-leaning media that critique Democratic leaders while maintaining some level of party loyalty."
245,Trump's SEC pick Atkins marks victory for establishment expertise,"WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - While Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief at President-elect Donald Trump's pick of respected Washington lawyer Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, critics worry his light-touch philosophy and crypto-friendly stance will hurt investors. After a string of controversial cabinet picks considered by critics to be lacking in qualifications, financial executives had wondered whether populist Trump loyalists were headed for the financial agencies too. But the choice of Atkins, a former top SEC official and well-liked veteran of financial and Republican circles, marked a victory for establishment expertise, said industry executives. Several people who have worked with Atkins also described him as highly professional, principled and fun. ""Paul is a quality pick who will have credibility on both sides of the aisle,"" said Stephen Crimmins, who worked as an enforcement attorney at the SEC for 14 years, overlapping with Atkins for some of that time. ""He knows securities regulation cold and has the people skills to get things done."" Atkins, 66, is familiar with both the complex plumbing of the markets and the inner workings of the 5,000-strong SEC, which oversees roughly 40,000 companies, as well as how Wall Street companies and other firms operate, the people said. After leaving the SEC, Atkins in 2009 founded consultancy Patomak Global Partners, located just around the corner from the White House. The firm has represented banks, financial technology firms and crypto companies in their dealings with the SEC and other regulators, according to its website. A self-avowed free marketeer, Atkins will be a marked change from the current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden. Gensler cracked down on Wall Street and crypto firms with a hard-nosed style that upset industry executives and even some congressional Democrats. Atkins' SEC knowledge and expertise will put him in a strong position to unpick some of Gensler's rules, especially short-sale regulations and climate disclosure rules already facing lawsuits, as well as cryptocurrency accounting restrictions. Still, Atkins is considered unlikely to fundamentally weaken the agency, a fear stoked by Elon Musk's role as co-head of a newly created government efficiency watchdog. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has clashed with the agency and repeatedly attacked it. ""He (Atkins) grew up with the SEC and recognizes the important purposes of the agency,"" Richard Hong, a partner with Morrison Cohen law firm who joined the SEC as a lawyer while Atkins was a commissioner there. Atkins and his representatives did not immediately respond to an email on Thursday seeking comment. But not everyone is cheering Atkins on. Pro-regulation progressive groups, as well as top Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, were quick to flag concerns over his industry ties and record championing light-touch enforcement while at the SEC. Atkins said at the time that big corporate penalties unduly punished shareholders who had already been hurt by the original misconduct. Speaking in February 2008 just months before the subprime mortgage crisis kicked into full swing, Atkins said the SEC should offer companies more transparency and predictability over enforcement probes and penalties. ""Atkins ... is smart, experienced, and capable. Unfortunately, he is also a deregulation zealot and industry cheerleader,"" said Dennis Kelleher, the CEO of Washington-based advocacy group Better Markets, who also noted that Atkins served in the Republican majority at the SEC in the years leading up to the 2008 crisis and the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scandal, opens new tab. Others warned that Atkins may give free reign to the crypto industry, which donated heavily to support Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and has pushed for a new industry-friendly SEC leader who will end Gensler's crackdown. Gensler is scheduled to step down on Jan. 20, 2025. Atkins has helped create best practices for crypto issuances and trading as co-chair of the Token Alliance, and is a member of the Chamber of Digital Commerce's advisory board. Bitcoin breached $100,000 for the first time on Wednesday on excitement over a SEC crypto policy overhaul under Atkins. ""Crypto companies' unprecedented political spending apparently just bought them control of the nation's investor protection police,"" said Bartlett Naylor, financial policy advocate at Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights group.",Reuters,Center,694,"Lean Right  
This article presents a generally positive view of Paul Atkins, highlighting his qualifications and support from industry insiders while mentioning concerns primarily from progressive critics. The language emphasizes establishment expertise and industry ties aligned with Republican ideologies, framing Atkins's appointment as a victory for traditional financial wisdom over populism. This reflects a tilt towards right-leaning perspectives that favor deregulation and business-friendly policies."

He posted on Truth Social, ""THANK YOU GOD! WON ALL SWING STATES, & THE POPULAR VOTE BY ALMOST 7 MILLION VOTERS..."" Democrats are fighting over who's to blame for their decisive defeat. Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi told The New York Times that if President Biden had relinquished his candidacy sooner, more candidates might have jumped in to create an open primary. Others, like California Rep. Ro Khanna, say the Harris team failed to address the concerns of everyday Americans. ""Anyone who's saying now this was not a winnable campaign, didn't say that back in August,"" he said. ""The reason we didn't win ultimately, is that we didn't listen enough to people on the ground... people who were saying talk about the economy, talk about people's economic struggles. Convince people you have the better policies and better vision."" Trump Builds New Team and Preps for Transition Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a three-term Republican senator from Florida, is Trump's choice to head the State Department, sources told The New York Times and confirmed to other outlets. The reports came with a caution that Trump could change his mind at the last minute, and Rubio's office has not commented. Meanwhile, the 45th president is working on filling key positions, announcing Sunday that Tom Homan will serve as ""border czar."" Trump posted on social media that Homan will be ""in charge of our Nation's Borders ('The Border Czar'), including, but not limited to, the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security"" and oversee a plan to deport immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally. Homan served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Trump's first term. On Monday, Trump also named his longtime adviser Stephen Miller, another immigration hard-liner, to be his deputy chief of policy. In addition, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik has been chosen to serve as ambassador to the United Nations and New York Rep. Lee Zeldin will serve as the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump also announced two people who won't be serving in his administration, posting on social media that Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo won't be asked to join his team.Both served in his first administration: Haley as ambassador to the U.N. and Pompeo as Secretary of State. Haley strongly criticized her former boss when she ran against him in the Republican primaries.

Sunday on NBC's 'Meet the Press', Barrasso said the Senate will move swiftly to approve Trump's nominees. ""He met huge resistance in 2016 and in 2017 getting his cabinet in place. What I'm hoping is in light of this huge landslide victory that we get a little more cooperation from the Democrats to get that cabinet in place on day one.""

290,"Apple, Trump and a booming budget surplus: Ireland has much to mull over as voters head to the polls","Ireland goes to the polls on Nov. 29, with center-right parties Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael once again expected to form the nucleus of the country’s next government. The historical rivals have shared power over the last five years alongside the Green Party, and the latest opinion polls show the two riding high, as the election campaign enters its final days. Whoever leads the country following the vote will face some unique economic challenges and opportunities: Ireland has a budget surplus, driven by its unique position as a European headquarters for major U.S. tech and pharmaceutical companies, while its balance sheet was boosted by a September ruling of the European Court of Justice, which ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($13.7 billion) in back taxes to the country. On the flipside, there are concerns in Dublin that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will look to clamp down on U.S. companies paying taxes in Ireland, instead of in America. The country’s two biggest parties look once again on track to form a government, despite some travails for Fine Gael as the campaign winds down. The latest Irish Times/Ipsos B&A poll of Nov. 25 shows support for Fine Gael falling six points to 19% over the last two weeks, while Fianna Fáil’s backing now stands at 21%. Support for Republican Party Sinn Féin, which posted major gains in the previous general election, currently sits at 20%, while independent candidates are polling at 17%. Ireland uses proportional voting, and if no party can claim a majority in the election, a coalition is certain. It is nevertheless unclear what policy changes can be expected, given the sway that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are likely to have in a potential government. Housing is a significant issue, with the Central Bank of Ireland warning in a recent September report that Ireland’s “housing market has been subject to more than a decade of under-supply”, adding that the surge in rent and house prices has stretched affordability. The central bank went on to forecast that “around 52,000 new homes could be needed per year out to the middle of the century, or a 20,000 unit increase relative to 2023 supply.” Homelessness across the country, particularly in Dublin, has reached record levels, with almost 15,000 people in emergency accommodation in September, of whom 4,561 were children, according to official figures. Despite concerns over tight housing supply, Emma Howard, economist at TU Dublin, said in an email to CNBC that Ireland still remains attractive to workers, given that it is “the only English speaking country with access to the European single market, and we have a relatively younger and more education workforce than our European counterparts.” The good news is that the country’s finances are on a strong footing, more than a decade after the government sought a bailout from the IMF, the ECB and the European Commission. A budget surplus has been recorded in the last two years, with Finance Minister Jack Chambers revealing in September that the country expects to record a surplus of up to €24 billion this year, driven by the ECJ ruling. An additional boost came in mid-November when S&P Global Ratings upped its outlook on Ireland to positive from stable, adding that it could potentially revise its ratings to AAA — the agency’s highest grade— if Dublin “continues to rebuild economic and fiscal buffers.” The report nevertheless came with a warning for authorities that 10 foreign-owned multinational enterprises were responsible for half of the country’s corporate tax receipts in 2023. However, Howard says “if the ‘windfall’ corporation taxes are removed, the proportion of government revenue that is not from domestic economic activity, Ireland actually has a budget deficit, and over the period 2024-2030 the current spending plans add up to a deficit of €50 billion.” Many of these are U.S. companies, and this is where clouds could appear on the horizon for the country. Donald Trump’s return to the White House has raised worldwide concerns, as the president-elect sets out to implement his “America First” policy. This could also threaten Ireland’s status as a tax favorite for American companies, with Dublin’s corporate tax rate currently sitting among the lowest across the Euro zone. Already, incoming Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick fired a shot across the bow in October, as he hit out at Ireland’s trade surplus with the U.S. Lutnick threatened to end what he described as “this nonsense.” The Cantor Fitzgerald CEO is set to also have “additional direct responsibility” for the U.S. Trade Representative’s office under the incoming administration. President-elect Trump himself has business ties to Ireland, owning a golf club on the west coast of the European country since 2014. He has previously used the resort as a base during visits to Ireland during his first presidential term.",CNBC,Center,797,"Lean Right  
This article presents a relatively neutral analysis of Ireland's political situation and economic challenges, while highlighting potential concerns regarding President-elect Trump's policies. However, it tends to emphasize the positive effects of low corporate tax rates and private enterprise, which align more closely with right-leaning economic ideologies. Overall, while it includes critical perspectives on housing issues and social concerns, the framing suggests a lean towards supporting market-driven solutions typically associated with right-leaning views."
121,Republicans Look To Reshape State Governments After Major 2024 Victories,"While the political world’s eyes are focused on Republicans winning trifecta control of the federal government for the first time since 2017, the GOP had many other major victories last week that deserve attention as well. Throughout the country, Republicans scored significant wins in state legislative races imperative to implementing a conservative agenda moving forward. In Arizona, Republicans are on track to maintain their majorities in the state House and Senate, preliminary election results from the New York Times suggest. Republicans could potentially expand their majorities in both chambers as well. The outcome marks a huge defeat for leftists, who spent millions of dollars to flip or “reach ties” in state legislatures including in Arizona, as The Federalist previously reported, where a slim GOP legislative majority separates the state from a Democrat trifecta takeover. In South Carolina, unofficial results indicate Republicans won a veto-proof supermajority in the state Senate and held onto their supermajority in the state House of Representatives. Similar trends are also reflected in Iowa’s preliminary results, which show the state GOP is already projected to expand its majority in the state House. In New Hampshire, Republicans are on track to maintain trifecta control of state government, according to early results. The GOP is projected to win the governor’s mansion and a supermajority in the Senate and could also expand its majority in the House compared to 2022 results. Despite efforts by Kansas Democrat Gov. Laura Kelly and Democrats to take down Republican legislative candidates this cycle, the Kansas GOP is not only projected to maintain its House and Senate supermajorities but is on track to grow them, preliminary results suggest. State Republicans have previously used their supermajorities to override Kelly’s vetoes on critical bills approved by the legislature, including one making it a felony for individuals to coerce pregnant women into getting abortions, as The Kansas City Star reported earlier this year. In Michigan, Republicans are projected to take back the state House of Representatives after losing the chamber during the 2022 midterms. The GOP’s victories disintegrate Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Democrats’ trifecta control, providing the party with a buffer to prevent Michigan leftists from enshrining their radical policies into law. Michigan Democrats’ defeats haven’t stopped them from attempting to use their final weeks in power to further their agenda, however. As my colleague Logan Washburn recently reported, the leftist party is seeking to pass legislation that would bind Michigan’s electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote in presidential elections. Republicans’ positive gains were also noticeable in Minnesota, the home state of Democrat Gov. Tim Walz — Vice President Harris’ running mate this cycle. According to local media, preliminary results show the state GOP breaking Democrats’ trifecta by splitting control of the state House, 67-67. Two of the races are headed for recounts, according to the local outlet, meaning a change in the outcome of one of the contests could tip the chamber to one party or the other. In Pennsylvania, the Keystone State GOP is projected to hold its majority in the Senate. Republicans did, however, come up short in their effort to reclaim the House of Representatives, where Democrats seemingly held onto their one-seat majority, according to preliminary results. Republicans also experienced success in states in which Democrats maintained their legislative majorities. As previously noted in the Las Vegas Sun, Nevada Republicans appear to be “on track to stave off a Democratic voting supermajority in the Nevada Assembly to protect Gov. Joe Lombardo’s veto power.” The outlet noted how the Republican governor vetoed 75 bills during last year’s legislative session. Vermont Republicans apparently gained enough seats to break Democrats’ supermajorities in the state House and Senate, as a local NBC affiliate reported last week. Democrats previously used these supermajorities to override vetoes by liberal Republican Gov. Phil Scott. Last year, for example, the Democrat-controlled legislature approved an amendment adopted by the City of Burlington allowing illegal aliens to vote in local elections. Scott vetoed the measure but was subsequently overridden by the legislature. Last week’s elections did come with some setbacks for conservatives, however. While Republicans are projected to hold majorities in the Wisconsin Legislature, they are on track to lose their supermajority in the state Senate. The expected results come after the state instituted Democrat-friendly redistricted maps for state races earlier this year. The state’s leftist-controlled supreme court shot down maps submitted by the GOP-led legislature last year. A similar trend also occurred in North Carolina, where Republicans are on track to maintain their legislative majorities but lose their supermajority in the state House by one seat, according to reports. The loss could prove consequential given Democrat Josh Stein’s victory in the state’s gubernatorial race against Republican Mark Robinson.",Federalist,Right,787,"Right  
The article emphasizes Republican victories in state legislatures while framing them as a triumph over leftist efforts, suggesting a strong bias toward Republican perspectives. It largely downplays Democratic wins and focuses on negative implications for Democratic policies, indicating a clear right-leaning perspective. The language used portrays Republicans positively and Democrats negatively, aligning with right-leaning media narratives."
240,Singapore-Based VC Firm Jungle Ventures Is On The Prowl To Tap New Frontiers,"As Southeast Asia’s funding winter for startups abates, it presents new opportunities for seed stage investments, says Amit Anand, cofounder and managing director of Singapore-based venture capital firm Jungle Ventures, speaking to Forbes on the sidelines of the Forbes Global CEO Conference held in Bangkok last month. “Seed funding is booming in Thailand and the Philippines so we want to do more there,” says Anand, 47, citing findings by Jungle Ventures’ inaugural First Cheque Report released in November. The report, which covers early stage investment trends in Southeast Asia and India, indicates that Thailand’s share of venture capital deals increased to 4% this year from 3% in 2021, while that of the Philippines rose to 6% from 5% over the same period. However, both countries still lag behind the rest of the region, which is dominated by Singapore, which accounted for over half of the deals this year, followed by Indonesia with 15% and Vietnam and Malaysia with 10% each, according to the report. Anand says the investment environment is stabilizing after both investments and deals started decreasing post-2022; as per the report, annual seed capital raised across India and Southeast Asia now stands at $1.5 billion, down from the peak of $3.2 billion raised in 2022. The deal count, meanwhile, has more than halved from 2,600 to 1,200. Jungle Ventures, which specializes in early and growth stage investments across Southeast Asia and India, has assets under management of over $1 billion. Its portfolio of 50 investee companies includes four unicorns: home décor and furnishing platform Livspace; Indonesian consumer lending app Kredivo; Moglix, an online seller of industrial tools; and AI-driven software development platform Builder.ai. Anand says startups in the Philippines and Thailand are attracting investors because the rapid development of digital infrastructure in both countries has enabled startups to launch internet-based apps even in remote rural areas. To further unlock this potential, he says, governments need to make the process of incorporating a business simpler and funding more accessible. While scouting for opportunities in the Philippines, Jungle Ventures met local founders, investors and ecosystem enablers in Manila. “We’re in the final stages of negotiations with our first Philippines-based investment,” he says. In Thailand, the firm has invested in fashion retailer Pomelo. Anand says India and Southeast Asia will remain attractive markets as they have the potential to offer VC investors with double-digit returns. In terms of sectors, He adds consumer-related startups remain promising, along with those in education, healthcare and finance. Jungle Ventures has completed nearly a dozen exits since it was founded in 2012 by Anand, a former tech executive, and tech entrepreneur Anurag Srivastasa, with a modest $10 million fund. The firm was an early investor in Malaysian video streaming service iFlix, which was acquired by Chinese billionaire Ma Huateng’s online gaming company Tencent Holdings in 2020 for an undisclosed amount. In the same year, Jungle Ventures and other investors sold Mumbai-based consumer lending platform PaySense to PayU, a digital payments gateway backed by South Africa’s Naspers, in a deal valued at $185 million. “We would have done more investments in the [Southeast Asia] region if there was a better IPO market,” he says. For example, Kredivo canceled a $2.5 billion SPAC deal in 2022 due to unfavourable market conditions. India, on the other hand, has a red-hot IPO market these days, says Anand, making it an attractive listing destination. Unicorns LivSpace and Moglix are planning to relocate their domiciles to India and list their companies there, he adds.",Forbes,Center,582,"Center

But the rebel offensive is part of a series of events that have been brewing in the Middle East for more than a year. Rebels captured Aleppo, the country's second-largest city, and pushed south for several days toward the capital. Collectively, the conflicts in the Middle East have destabilized the wider region and helped reignite the civil war in Syria that had been in a stalemate for years. The margin for the popular vote in this year's presidential election is the second-closest since 1968, and it's still tightening. With 96% of the vote in, Trump has 49.97% and Vice President Harris has 48.36%, according to the Associated Press. These results show that Trump doesn't exactly have the ""unprecedented and powerful mandate"" he claimed on election night.

Still, the two men could meet again as soon as Saturday in Paris, which hosted the 2024 Olympics that L.A. originally bid for. Trump is traveling to the French capital for ceremonies this weekend to reopen Notre Dame Cathedral that was devastated by fire five years ago. Bach also is invited to return to the Olympic host city where he has excellent relations with French President Emmanuel Macron, who formally opened the Summer Games on July 26. President Trump should do the same duty at the L.A. Olympics opening ceremony on July 14, 2028, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. Though the L.A. Olympics are privately funded and organized, federal government guarantees and funding are needed for security, as well as providing visas to ensure athletes, coaches and officials from 206 national teams, plus a refugees team, can enter the U.S. to train and compete. Bach said Thursday responsibility for “taking early contact with the incoming team” of the Trump administration is with organizing committee officials in L.A., and leaders of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee. “We are very confident there with regard to the steps and efforts being undertaken,” Bach said at a news conference after an executive board meeting of the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne, Switzerland. “We saw also that President-elect Trump repeatedly declared his support for the Games, which we never had any doubt because he has declared this support from the very beginning.” On Wednesday, Trump said he appointed Monica Crowley as his representative for “major U.S. hosted events,” including the L.A. Olympics and the 2026 World Cup in men’s soccer. Trump will be invited as head of state by FIFA to present the trophy to the winning captain at the World Cup final. That game is on July 19, 2026, at MetLife Stadium near New York City. “The World Cup and the Olympics, I was responsible for getting both of them, actually,” Trump told Bill Belichick on the “Let’s Go!” podcast before the Nov. 5 election. The U.S. will co-host soccer’s biggest event with Canada and Mexico, having beaten the rival bid of Morocco in a June 2018 vote in Moscow by FIFA member federations. Trump has had a warmer relationship with FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who twice visited the White House in the first administration. They also co-headlined at Davos, Switzerland, in January 2020 in an event on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. On Thursday, Trump’s video message to FIFA, expressing his “highest regards and respect to Gianni,” was broadcast at the soccer body’s draw ceremony in Miami for the 2025 Club World Cup. It was attended by Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner. The IOC said its commissioned research showed 5 billion people — 84% of the potential global audience aged over 4 years old — followed the Paris Olympics. “These Olympic Games met the expectations of the world,” Bach said.",WashingtonTimes,Lean Right,549,"Lean Right

43,How Mike Johnson could flounder as speaker — 'even with total control of government',"Democrats suffered three major disappointments in the 2024 election when President-elect Donald Trump narrowly defeated Vice President Kamala Harris and Republicans flipped the U.S. Senate while keeping their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. But progressive journalist and former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan has been arguing that Republicans are being disingenuous when they use words like ""landslide,"" ""historic"" and ""blowout"" to describe the election results. Trump, according to the Cook Political Report, won the popular vote by roughly 1.4 or 1.5 percent — which, as Hasan has noted, is far from a ""landslide."" In 2025, Republicans' 53-47 majority in the U.S. Senate will hardly qualify as a supermajority. And House Speaker Mike Johnson, the New York Times' Catie Edmondson emphasizes in an article published on December 4, will have very little wiggle room in 2025 when he leads a narrow majority. READ MORE:Alarm raised over Trump plot to install nominees without Senate approval ""Speaker Mike Johnson's small majority just got even smaller,"" Edmondson reports. ""On Tuesday night, (December 3), the final House race was called after Rep. John Duarte of California, a freshman Republican, conceded to Adam Gray, a Democrat, cementing a 220-215 majority for Republicans in a margin even slimmer than they have now, at 220-213. Those margins will erode even further in January, when Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York and Mike Waltz of Florida resign to take jobs in the Trump Administration. The Times reporter adds, ""Former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has also given notice that he will not return. Republicans will then be down to a 217-215 majority, on par with the narrowest controlling margin in House history."" With a majority that small, Edmondson notes, Johnson will have precious little room for error. ""If all Democrats are present and united in opposition to a measure,"" according to Edmondson, ""Mr. Johnson won't be able to afford a single defection on the House floor until those vacancies are filled later this spring. Even then, no more than three Republicans can break ranks without dooming a bill's passage.""

The article presents a critical perspective on Republican performance in recent elections and suggests that their claims of victory are exaggerated. It highlights discrepancies in their portrayal of election results by referencing a progressive journalist. The focus on challenges within the Republican party, especially regarding House Speaker Mike Johnson's leadership, aligns with a more left-leaning critique of conservative governance. Overall, the emphasis on Democratic viewpoints and the framing of Republican strategy indicates a lean towards leftist media bias."
185,Why is this European city ranked the No. 1 place in the world for expats?,"Are you considering a move abroad, or being asked to relocate for work? A new ranking of international cities' quality of life sheds light on which global locales offer the greatest appeal for expats. A new Quality of Living City Ranking from global consulting firm Mercer lists more than 240 cities across five continents in order of their quality-of-life ratings. The report took into account living standards, cultural environment, housing, infrastructure, air quality and other features that can make a city either an attractive or uninspiring place to live. Zurich, Switzerland, a global financial hub known for its exceptional public services, safety and vibrant cultural scene, took the top spot. Vienna, Austria, placed second, while Geneva, Switzerland, came in third. One factor that helped propel Zurich to the top of the list is that it recently improved its airport connections, making it a practical home base for people looking to travel to or from other continents. Of the top 10 cities, eight are located in Europe. Auckland, New Zealand, ranked fifth, while Vancouver, British Columbia, ranked seventh. Singapore was the only Asian city in the top 50, according to Mercer. ""In an era of digital nomads and flexible working, countries and cities are consistently working to attract international businesses, talent and remote workers,"" Mercer said in a statement. ""The most successful destinations today are those that blend flexible governance around mobile talent with a high quality of life and an affordable cost of living.""

28,Barron Trump Introduces Himself In Video With Donald Trump And People Have Same Reaction,"Barron Trump speaks! That was the reaction of many on social media who viewed President-elect Donald Trump’s youngest son introducing himself in a video shared Wednesday by the “Art of the Surge” documentary series. (Watch the clip below.) Viewers said it was the first time they had heard the 18-year-old NYU freshman talk after he was mostly being shielded from public life growing up. In the clip, the younger Trump greets someone who is off-camera. “Hello, how are you? It’s very nice to see you. It’s very nice.” Barron Trump’s quick repeat of “it’s very nice” is also reminiscent of his dad’s speech pattern, with some noting the son’s similar “mannerisms” and “voice.” The very tall scion then offered a “good to see you” to UFC boss Dana White. The president-elect expressed surprise the two had never met and jokingly asked White, “Can we make him a fighter?” The teenage Trump, who is credited with helping his dad court the young man, or “bro,” vote, will likely not be a regular at the White House the second time around. He’s living at home in Manhattan’s Trump Tower while attending NYU in the Stern School of Business a few miles south, according to his mother, Melania Trump. “I could not say I’m an empty nester. I don’t feel that way,” the former and future first lady told “Fox & Friends” in late September. “It was his decision to come here, that he wants to be in New York and study in New York and live in his home, and I respect that.” “He’s enjoying his college days,” she added. “I hope he will have a great experience because his life is very different than any other 18, 19-year-old child.”",Huffpost,Left,288,"Center

18,Republicans quietly admit Trump policies could 'prove disastrous' in their areas,"President-elect Donald Trump isn't known for making a lot of political comprises. Many times, he has doubled down on his most controversial positions — for example, vowing to impose across-the-board tariffs of 25 percent on goods imported into the United States from Canada and Mexico as soon as he returns to the White House. Trump's tariff proposals have drawn blistering criticism from countless economists and business leaders, yet he isn't backing down. In an article published by The New Republic on December 5, journalist Greg Sargent details a variety of Trump proposals that are worrying Republicans even in GOP-dominated areas. READ MORE:'I've seen tougher guys at Starbucks': MAGA country star turns on Republican senator According to Sargent, ""Republicans or GOP-adjacent industries"" have ""already begun to admit out loud that some of his most important policy promises could prove disastrous in their parts of the country."" ""These folks don't say this too directly, out of fear of offending the MAGA God King,"" Sargent observes. ""Instead, they suggest gingerly that a slight rethink might be in order. But unpack what they're saying, and you'll see that they're in effect acknowledging that some of Trump's biggest campaign promises were basically scams."" Sargent continues, ""In Georgia, for instance, some local Republicans are openly worried about Trump's threat to roll back President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into incentives for the manufacture and purchase of green energy technologies, from electric vehicles to batteries to solar power.""

""Those workers enable the state to keep growing despite a native population that isn't supplying a large enough workforce. Local analysts and executives want Trump to refrain from removing all these people or create new ways for them to work here legally."" Sargent continues, ""Even the Republican mayor of McKinney, Texas is loudly sounding the alarm. Meanwhile, back in Georgia, Trump's threat of mass deportations is awakening new awareness that undocumented immigrants drive industries like construction, landscaping, and agriculture, reports The Wall Street Journal.

The article critiques Donald Trump's policies and suggests that even Republicans are worried about the potential negative impacts of these policies on their constituencies. It emphasizes feedback from a primarily left-leaning publication, The New Republic, along with sources that raise concerns about Trump's proposed actions, particularly regarding immigration and environmental policies. The inference that Trump's ideas are close to ""scams"" and the focus on the economic harm his proposals might cause reflect a leaning left perspective, targeting potential negative outcomes of right-leaning policies."
27,"Republican Austin Theriault ends recount, conceding to Democratic US Rep. Jared Golden","PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Republican Austin Theriault on Wednesday ended a recount in his congressional race in Maine and conceded to Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, bringing to an end the closely watched contest a month after Election Day. Theriault decided to end the recount before its completion after early results did not show a significant change in the outcome after Golden won by 2,706 votes using the state’s ranked choice voting. “I ran this campaign centered around putting people over politics, and it’s time to do that now,” Theriault announced, calling the contest “an extremely close and hard-fought race.” Between ranked voting and the recount, the election was a drawn-out process. Golden won the most first-choice votes but fell shy of a majority with less than 49% of the votes cast because about 12,000 ballots were either blank or had write-in candidates. That necessitated another voting round in which ballots were brought to Augusta, entered into a computer and reallocated with the second choices from ballots that were blank or had write-in candidates. The Associated Press declared Golden the 2nd Congressional District winner upon conclusion of the process more than a week after Election Day. The recount began Monday. “I’d like to thank the voters for participating in the greatest democracy the world has ever known, and all the staff and volunteers who helped ensure the election’s integrity on Election Day, during the runoff and over the course of this recount,” said Golden, who was in Washington when Theriault called to concede Wednesday. This race drew attention and more than $50 million in spending as both parties fought to control the House of Representatives. Golden, a Marine Corps veteran who demonstrated a willingness to defy his own party, campaigned on his ability to work with both Democrats and Republicans. He also touted his advocacy for the lobster industry, which is crucial to the economy in the region. But Golden was attacked for his opposition to assault weapons, which he announced after an Army reservist used an assault rifle to kill 18 people and injure 13 others in Lewiston in October 2023. Theriault, a former NASCAR driver, had the backing of President-elect Donald Trump, but he also portrayed himself as a potential uniter during a time of division. “We need more balance and less extremism in Washington,” Theriault said previously. It was the third time Golden won through an additional voting round under ranked voting. The system allows voters to rank candidates on the ballot and allows for additional voting rounds to ensure a majority winner. Ranked choice tabulations allowed Golden to unseat Republican incumbent Rep. Bruce Poliquin in 2018, and to win a rematch in 2022. This story has been corrected to show Jared Golden received the most first-place votes.",APNEWS,Left,461,"Center

According to the Social Security Administration, SSI payments are given to people living with debilitating disabilities that affect their income. To meet eligibility requirements, filers need to be at least partially blind or have a “physical or mental condition(s) that seriously limits their daily activities for 12 months or more or may be expected to result in death.” The amount received depends on several factors, including the number of people filing. Applicants filing individually can receive up to $943 per month, couples filing jointly can receive up to $1,415, and essential persons, or those who provide SSI recipients with necessary care, can receive up to $472.

149,Democrats Tell Biden to Get as Many Migrants Possible into U.S. Before Leaving Office,"A few Senate Democrats are lobbying President Joe Biden to get as many migrants into the United States as possible and ensure they stay indefinitely before he leaves office and President-elect Donald Trump enters the White House. This week, Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), and Alex Padilla (D-CA) sent a letter to Biden asking him to reward large groups of illegal aliens and other migrants in the U.S. with immigration benefits before he exits office next month. “In addition to supporting strong border security, we are eager to ensure that DACA recipients, TPS holders, and other immigrants who are critical members of our communities and economies are not forgotten during this busy time,” the Senators write. In particular, the Senators want Biden to allow hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to extend their status for the maximum length of time that is allowed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Similarly, the Senators are asking Biden to extend and redesignate several countries for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) so that newly arrived migrants from such countries can stay in the U.S. while those already in the U.S. can stay even longer than currently granted. “What I take is what I hear from this incoming administration, they’re going to engage in mass deportation and nobody is safe,” Cortez Masto told MSNBC this week. “That’s why I’m asking the administration to come in now to protect some of the immigrant communities — TPS recipients, DACA recipients.” Already, the Biden administration has grown the foreign-born population by nearly seven million since January 2021 — ballooning the number of foreign nationals living in the U.S. to an unprecedented nearly 52 million.

340,"Ex-officials call for closed-door Senate hearings on Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s pick for intel chief","WASHINGTON — Nearly 100 former senior U.S. diplomats and intelligence and national security officials have urged Senate leaders to schedule closed-door hearings to allow for a full review of the government’s files on former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump’s pick to be national intelligence director. The former officials, who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, said they were “alarmed” by the choice of Gabbard to oversee all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies. They said her past actions “call into question her ability to deliver unbiased intelligence briefings to the President, Congress, and to the entire national security apparatus.” A spokesperson for Gabbard on the Trump transition team on Thursday denounced the appeal as an “unfounded” and “partisan” attack. Avril Haines, the current director of national intelligence, when asked Thursday whether intelligence sharing with allies could be in jeopardy under the next administration, cited the importance of those relationships and noted the strong bipartisan support for them in Congress. The question, at a Council on Foreign Relations talk, focused on the especially close intelligence sharing among the Five Eyes - the U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It did not mention Gabbard by name. “It is hard for me to believe that anybody coming in wouldn’t want to maintain those relationships,” Haines said. “So I wouldn’t think of them as being in a significant risk,” she added. “I certainly hope that will continue.” Among those who signed the letter were former Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, former NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller, former national security adviser Anthony Lake, and numerous retired ambassadors and high-ranking military officers. They wrote to current Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and incoming Republican Majority Leader John Thune on Wednesday to urge the closed briefings as part of the Senate’s review of Trump’s top appointments. They requested that Senate committees “consider in closed sessions all information available to the U.S. government when considering Ms. Gabbard’s qualifications to manage our country’s intelligence agencies, and more importantly, the protection of our intelligence sources and methods.” The letter singles out Gabbard’s 2017 meetings in Syria with President Bashar Assad, who is supported by Russian, Iranian and Iranian-allied forces in a now 13-year war against Syrian opposition forces seeking his overthrow. The U.S., which cut relations with Assad’s government and imposed sanctions over his conduct of the war, maintains about 900 troops in opposition-controlled northeast Syria, saying they are needed to block a resurgence of extremist groups. Gabbard, a Democratic member of Congress from Hawaii at the time of her Syria trip, drew heavy criticism for her meetings with a U.S. adversary and brutal leader. As the letter notes, her statements on the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine have aligned with Russian talking points, diverging from U.S. positions and policy. Gabbard throughout her political career has urged the U.S. to limit military engagement abroad other than combatting Islamic extremist groups. She has defended the Syria trip by saying it is necessary to engage with U.S. enemies. In postings on social media earlier this year she confirmed that the U.S. had for a time placed her “on a secret terror watch list” as a “potential domestic terror threat.” She blamed political retaliation. Neither she nor U.S. authorities have publicly detailed the circumstances involved. Alexa Henning, a spokesperson for Gabbard with the Trump team, called the letter sent to the Senate leaders “a perfect example” of why Trump chose Gabbard for this position. “These unfounded attacks are from the same geniuses who have blood on their hands from decades of faulty ‘intelligence,’” and use classified government information as a “partisan weapon to smear and imply things about their political enemy,” Henning said. A spokesperson for Thune did not immediately respond to questions about the request. • Associated Press writer Didi Tang contributed.",WashingtonTimes,Lean Right,635,"Center  
The article presents a straightforward recounting of events surrounding the appointment of Tulsi Gabbard as Trump’s pick for national intelligence director, featuring various viewpoints. It includes criticisms from former diplomats and a defense from Gabbard’s spokesperson, without apparent favoritism toward one side. The focus on bipartisan concerns about her qualifications suggests a neutral tone rather than a political bias, indicating that it aligns with a Center classification."
299,Ramaswamy says DOGE will scrutinize Rivian loan and CHIPS Act awards,"Vivek Ramaswamy is ready to put President Joe Biden’s quote “last minute spending spree” under a microscope. The incoming co-lead of President-elect Donald Trump’s newly created Department of Government Efficiency is taking issue with deals he says are being done in the 11th hour. What’s raising eyebrows on the other side is what’s high on Ramaswamy’s list of spending to claw back: a $6.6 billion loan to EV maker Rivian from the Department of Energy announced last month. Rivian is a rival to Tesla, where DOGE co-chair Elon Musk is the CEO. VIVEK RAMASWAMY: Anybody who’s offering recommendations, you should always have a skeptical lens to look at. What are their motivations for making that recommendation? I say that’s the best advice I’d give the public. Always be skeptical when somebody’s making a recommendation Simone Del Rosario: During a Q&A at CNBC’s CFO Council Summit this week, Ramaswamy says he doesn’t think the loan will be paid back. The Rivian loan is to build a factory in Georgia. It won’t be final until the Energy Department and Rivian sign a contract, which The New York Times reports is expected to happen before Trump’s inauguration. These loans do become the government’s responsibility if a company goes bankrupt. The Obama administration’s loan to solar panel company Solyndra is a prime example. In that case, taxpayers took a half-a-billion-dollar hit. As of the end of September, DOE had financed $44 billion in loans, taking $1 billion in losses. The DOE says its “Loan Programs Office provides attractive debt financing for high-impact, large-scale energy infrastructure projects in the United States.” Ramaswamy said no program is off limits for DOGE, including “last minute [Inflation Reduction Act], CHIPS Act, and countless other federal spending sprees authorized under Biden.” The IRA and the CHIPS Act are two of Biden’s biggest signature policies passed during his 4-year term. After Trump won presidential election, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo talked about the race against the clock. Gina Raimondo: “I’d like to have the, really, almost all the money obligated by the time we leave. That’s the goal.” Simone Del Rosario: At that time, Ramaswamy posted on X, “This is highly inappropriate: they’re accelerating spending ahead of the transition of power.” It’s not clear under what authority DOGE would have to claw back any spending. In most cases, the funding has already been appropriated as part of large legislation or in funding to agencies that disperse the money. Only Congress has authority to change appropriations. Ramaswamy and Musk took their DOGE pitch to lawmakers on Capitol Hill Thursday. This week, Ramaswamy compared Biden’s spending to a company firing an executive, who in their final days approved spending that hadn’t yet been doled out. VIVEK RAMASWAMY: And I think if you view the way the federal government spends the taxpayer money, and that was in a corporate context that would be a fiduciary breach. Hands down. I think the officers of that public company would, at minimum, be fired, and at worst, be civilly or worse, in court over the dereliction of duty Simone Del Rosario: For his part, when Trump was a lame duck president following the 2020 election, he signed a new $2.3 trillion spending bill to fund the government, which included $900 billion in COVID-19 relief.",SAN,Center,547,"Lean Right  
The article reflects a critical perspective on President Biden's spending policies, particularly regarding last-minute allocations and the Rivian loan. It highlights Republican viewpoints, including quotes from Vivek Ramaswamy that suggest skepticism about government spending under the Biden administration. Additionally, it contrasts Trump's spending actions with those of Biden, which indicates a right-leaning bias. The article frames these financial matters in a way that generally aligns with Republican critiques of Democratic governance."

Authorities told the New York Times they believe a gunman targeted a northern California school Wednesday — wounding two kindergartners — because of the school's affiliation with the Seventh-day Adventist Church.The shooting victims — two boys, ages 5 and 6 — are now in ""critical but stable condition,"" the Butte County Sheriff's Office told KOVR-TV in a Thursday report. The suspect was found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the sheriff's office added to the station. A California Highway Patrol officer found a handgun next to the suspect, KOVR noted.A 6th-grade student said she helped her teacher comfort younger students as the gunman was outside the classroom.The shooting happened around 1 p.m. Wednesday at the Feather River School of Seventh-Day Adventists in Palermo, authorities told the station.The Times said authorities did not provide more information about why the gunman wanted to target the Seventh-day Adventists, but the paper added that Sheriff Kory Honea said it was believed to be an isolated incident.While authorities weren't aware of any prior threats the gunman made against the school or other schools connected with the Seventh-day Adventists, the Times said neighboring communities were alerted about the possible motive, and police were dispatched to other schools affiliated with the church.What else do we know?The two shooting victims were taken to a Sacramento-area hospital and were in ""extremely critical condition,"" Honea said Wednesday, according to KOVR.While they were in ""critical but stable"" condition Thursday, the station said the two students are continuing to received treatment at a local hospital.The sheriff's office told KOVR the suspect has been positively identified, but his name has not been released. Deputies said they don't believe there is any connection between the suspect and the victims, the station said.Honea added to KOVR that investigators are looking into a ""story"" that the suspect called a few days prior to the shooting to schedule a Wednesday appointment at the school with an administrator. The station said reports indicate the suspect showed up trying to enroll a child, but deputies don't believe a child was with him.After the Wednesday meeting with the administrator, gunshots were heard, Honea told KOVR. A 6th-grade student said she helped her teacher comfort younger students as the gunman was outside the classroom, the station said.The school serves about 35 students from kindergarten to eighth grade, KOVR said, adding that Honea indicated no security officer was stationed at the school, and that's not part of the school's everyday routine.Students were taken to the gymnasium until authorities could bring school buses to the scene, the station said, adding that they were taken to the Oroville Church of the Nazarene where they were reunited with their families.Honea also told KOVR an Uber driver dropped off the suspect at the school, and investigators are interviewing the driver to learn more information about what may have transpired before and during the ride.More from the station:The shooting appears to be isolated to the Feather River School of Seventh-Day Adventists, but Honea said he provided other law enforcement agencies in California with information to be vigilant when it comes to Seventh-Day Adventist schools as it appears the school may have been targeted due to its affiliation.The Times said Elizabeth Lepe Arredondo — a former teacher at the school whose children were also students — described Feather River as a beautiful school “out in the open country"" with a strong sense of community and values deeply rooted in the teachings of Seventh-day Adventist Church.KOVR described Palermo as a town populated by more than 5,000 people and situated just south of Oroville, about 30 miles south of Chico, and 65 miles north of Sacramento.You can view a video report here about the shooting.Like Blaze News?

This article is being updated regularly with the latest announcements: Attorney General of the United States On Wednesday, Trump nominated Congressman Matt Gaetz, of Florida, to be the Attorney General of the United States, calling him ""a Champion for the Constitution and the Rule of Law."" Gaetz was trained as an attorney at the prestigious William & Mary College of Law and he has been serving on the House Judiciary Committee which oversees the Dept. of Justice. Trump said in a statement, ""Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System. Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans' badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department."" Non-Cabinet Dept. of Government Efficiency Billionaire CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy will team up to head up a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a non-cabinet post. In a statement, Trump said, ""Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies."" In a post on X, Musk wrote that the department's findings will be published online ""for maximum transparency,"" and will feature a ""leaderboard for the most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars."" Secretary of Defense A surprise choice for the Department of Defense as Trump selected longtime Fox News host Pete Hegseth to oversee the Pentagon. About Hegseth, who served in Afghanistan, the president-elect wrote, “Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First. With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice – Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down.” Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal recently reported, ""The Trump transition team is considering a draft executive order that establishes a 'warrior board' of retired senior military personnel with the power to review three- and four-star officers and to recommend removals of any deemed unfit for leadership."" It could bring unprecedented scrutiny to what President Dwight Eisenhower called ""The Military-Industrial Complex."" CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who served as President Trump's Director of National Intelligence at the end of his first term, is slated to take over at Langley. Ratcliffe is a trusted ally of the president and was a vocal critic of the Biden administration's Israel policy. Ambassador to Israel Trump announced on Tuesday afternoon he's nominating former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee as the ambassador to Israel. Huckabee is a staunch defender of Israel and has led tour group visits to the country for decades. ""Mike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years. He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East,"" Trump said in a statement. Huckabee is a former Baptist minister and Fox News host. He currently hosts the ""Huckabee"" show for the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN). The hour-long program is ""a down-home slice of wholesome Americana in all of its patriotic, God-honoring, and family-friendly glory,"" according to a website description. His daughter, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, served as White House press secretary during Trump's first presidency. David Friedman, who served as Trump's ambassador to Israel during his first term, said he was “thrilled” by Trump's selection of Huckabee. Secretary of State Trump confirmed Wednesday that he's nominating Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) to be his Secretary of State. “He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,” Trump said of Rubio in a statement. Rubio has a hard-line position on foreign policy, often butting heads with Republicans ""about interventions abroad."" The Florida senator could play a major role in Trump's ""America First"" idea due to his strong stance on China, Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba. He also sides with Trump about bringing a ""conclusion"" to Russia's war with Ukraine and has been outspoken ""on the need for the United States to be more aggressive on China,"" the NY Times reports. After Trump won the election last Tuesday, Rubio said the U.S. would see ""pragmatic foreign policy"" from the White House. ""We're entering into an era of pragmatic foreign policy in which the world is rapidly changing,"" Rubio said in an interview with CNN. ""Adversaries are uniting — North Korea, Iran, China, Russia [are] increasingly coordinating — it's going to require us to be very pragmatic and wise and how we invest overseas and what we do."" If confirmed, Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, would become the first Latino to ever serve as the nation's top diplomat. National Security Advisor The news came shortly after the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had tapped Florida Congressman Mike Waltz to be his national security advisor. The national security advisor is a highly influential post appointed by the president that doesn't require Senate confirmation. This person is assigned to coordinate among all the top national security agencies and is tasked with briefing the president and executing his policies. Waltz is the first retired Green Beret to serve in Congress and was one of Trump's most visible campaign surrogates often making an appeal to military members. He also helped with the Veterans For Trump coalition, Fox News reports. As a House member, Waltz has served on the Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, and Intelligence committees. Waltz would step into this role as national security adviser amid conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. According to the New York Center for Foreign Policy Affairs, Trump ""will focus on restoring deterrence, fostering transactional relationships with allies, and intensifying diplomatic engagement in global conflicts."" Secretary of Homeland Security Meanwhile, the President-elect has reportedly tapped South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to fulfill the role of Secretary of Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security oversees U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Secret Service, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Noem has served as governor of the Mount Rushmore State since 2019 and has sent troops from the South Dakota National Guard to serve along the U.S. southern border with Mexico on multiple occasions. Noem was thought to be a potential running mate for Trump earlier this year but fell out of contention after her book titled No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward, came out in May. The publication sparked outrage for a story written about her dog named Cricket. She had to put the dog down, according to excerpts first reported by The Guardian. Noem says she included that excerpt in the story to illustrate her willingness in politics to do anything ""difficult, messy and ugly"" if it needs to be done. As of Tuesday morning, the Trump transition team had not made an official announcement about Noem or Rubio's potential positions. UN Ambassador and 'Border Czar' Trump has already named New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Tom Homan as ""border czar"", responsible for securing the border and deporting immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally. ***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.***",CBN,Right,1248,"Right

115,Exclusive — Rep. Warren Davidson: Pete Hegseth the ‘Kind of Guy We Need Leading the Department of Defense’,"Pete Hegseth is “the kind of guy we need leading the Department of Defense,” Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) said during an appearance on Breitbart News Daily, contrasting him with President Biden’s Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, “who thinks the biggest threat to national security is climate change.” Davidson said part of his role in the confirmation process of President-elect Trump’s nominees is peer pressure and “trying to influence senators that we have relationships with [and] trying to find out who the senators that, you know, have reservations.” Inside the Pete Hegseth Confirmation Battle with Matt Boyle As an example, Davidson, a former Army ranger, pointed out that he promoted Pete Hegseth on Wednesday. “He’s the kind of guy we need leading the Department of Defense. … Pete Hegseth was a combat veteran, led infantry line units in combat, and he’s talked all about how to make the military focused on the combat mission,” Davidson said, contrasting Hegseth with Austin. “And now you’ve got a secretary, Lloyd Austin, who thinks the biggest threat to national security is climate change, who’s walking around talking about a chairman of the joint chiefs, Milley. He’s talking about the big risk of white rage in the military and all kinds of woke agenda, which is why, you know, Biden and Obama picked these kind of guys,” he observed. “And how do you get our military back to a lean, mean fighting machine focused on fighting and winning wars, and then a State Department that could actually say no to some of them. And I think Pete Hegseth checks both of those boxes. Like, yes, if we need to win a war, we’re going to go in and win. But just like Dwight Eisenhower did back in the day in Korea, he said, you know, we don’t have to get involved in every war we’re invited to,” Davidson said. LISTEN: Breitbart · Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) – December 5, 2024 “Let’s wrap this thing up. And I mean, I think that’s the time we’re in right now. We don’t need to create World War III in Ukraine. We don’t need to be dragged into another war in the Middle East unnecessarily. And the best way to do that, as Donald Trump has said, is peace through strength,” he added.

Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary, is fighting to save his nomination by defending himself against allegations of drinking and womanizing. In an interview with Megyn Kelly on her SiriusXM show, Hegseth said he has Trump's support. He is the latest of Trump's nominees to run into trouble. A manhunt is underway after Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was gunned down and killed in New York City. He was shot yesterday morning, on the day of his employer's annual investors conference. Authorities say it was a targeted attack. If Trump's plan to deport millions of people from the U.S. succeeds, his administration won't be the first. Millions of people have been deported during past administrations, providing an opportunity to answer the question: Does deporting a lot of foreign workers improve the job market for U.S. citizens and people who reside in the country legally?

39,Alarm raised over Trump plot to install nominees without Senate approval,"Republican U.S. Senator John Thune (R-SD), who was elected to become the next Senate Majority Leader, gestures as he speaks to the media after a U.S. Senate Republicans meeting to vote on leadership positions for the 119th Congress, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., November 13, 2024. REUTERS/Leah Millis Dozens of civil rights and pro-democracy organizations teamed up Wednesday to express opposition to President-elect Donald Trump's push to use recess appointments to evade the Senate confirmation process for his political nominees, many of which have glaring conflicts of interest. The 70 groups—including People For the American Way, Public Citizen, the Constitutional Accountability Center, and the NAACP—sent a letter to U.S. senators arguing that Senate confirmation procedures provide ""crucial data"" that helps lawmakers and the public ""evaluate nominees' fitness for the important positions to which they are nominated."" ""The framers of the Constitution included the requirement of Senate 'Advice and Consent' for high-ranking officers for a reason: The requirement can protect our freedom, just as the Bill of Rights does, by providing an indispensable check on presidential power,"" reads the new letter. ""None of that would happen with recess appointments. The American people would be kept in the dark."" Since his victory in last month's election, Trump has publicly expressed his desire to bypass the often time-consuming Senate confirmation process via recess appointments, which are allowed under the Constitution and have been used in the past by presidents of both parties. The need for Senate confirmation is already proving to be a significant obstacle for the incoming administration: Trump's first attorney general nominee, Matt Gaetz, withdrew amid seemingly insurmountable Senate opposition, and Pentagon nominee Pete Hegseth appears to be on the ropes. ""Giving in to the president-elect's demand for recess appointments under the current circumstances would dramatically depart from how important positions have always been filled at the start of an administration,"" the groups wrote in their letter. ""The confirmation process gathers important information that helps ensure that nominees who will be dangerous or ineffective for the American people are not confirmed and given great power, and that those who are confirmed meet at least a minimum standard of acceptability."" ""The American people deserve full vetting of every person selected to serve in our nation's highest offices, and Trump's nominees are no exception."" Scholars argue recess appointments were intended as a way for presidents to appoint officials to key posts under unusual circumstances, not as an exploit for presidents whose nominees run up against significant opposition. The Senate could prevent recess appointments by refusing to officially go on recess and making use of pro forma sessions, but incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has said that ""we have to have all the options on the table"" to push through Trump's nominees. ""We are not going to allow the Democrats to thwart the will of the American people in giving President Trump the people that he wants in those positions to implement his agenda,"" Thune said last month. Trump has also previously threatened to invoke a never-before-used provision of the Constitution that he claims would allow him to force both chambers of Congress to adjourn, paving the way for recess appointments. Conservative scholar Edward Whelan, a distinguished senior fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, denounced that proposed route as a ""cockamamie scheme"" that would mean ""eviscerating the Senate's advice-and-consent role."" Svante Myrick, president of People For the American Way, said in a statement Wednesday that ""if you're trying to ram through nominees without Senate and public scrutiny, it's a pretty good guess that you have something to hide."" ""The American people deserve full vetting of every person selected to serve in our nation's highest offices,"" said Myrick, ""and Trump's nominees are no exception.""",AlterNet,Left,624,"Lean Left  
This article expresses concern about President-elect Donald Trump's attempts to bypass the Senate confirmation process for his nominees, framing it as a threat to democracy and public scrutiny. The language employed by civil rights and pro-democracy organizations emphasizes the importance of checks and balances, which aligns with a more progressive stance.

Since age five, she has been doing charity work and organizing blood and food drives, among other relief efforts for disaster victims. Liebowitz’s motive has always been to do the right thing simply. This endeavor, however, is much more personal after she saw her friend Aidan battle acute myeloid leukemia for half a year in the cancer center. “I tried to relate it to myself and think about how I would have felt in his shoes,” she said. “Even though it can seem so isolating in a hospital, there are so many people who can come together and try to brighten your day, give you the support you need, or even just a toy you want.” During treatment, Aidan quickly realized he could pay it forward for the younger patients on his floor, too. 4 Since age five, she has been doing charity work and organizing blood and food drives, among other relief efforts for disaster victims. Courtesy Eliza Liebowtiz He became a liaison to Liebowitz and would let her know exactly what other kids wanted to play with. The list included Legos, board games, Ninja Turtles toys and Madlibs.

Aidan’s mother, Randi, who asked the family name not be used, said kids being able to hold onto Barbie dolls and action figures are instrumental. “It really helps them to feel strong,” Randi told The Post. “If they could forget why they are there, even for just a few minutes, that’s very helpful.” Liebowitz estimates that she has brought around 300 toys to Memorial Sloan Kettering. “My heart is full,” Donna Liebowitz, 55. “I hope this is something Eliza passes down for generations.” 4 Liebowitz mentioned that another teen in Roslyn is also looking into creating a drive.

He took up a collection and will send over 100 toys to Memorial Sloan Kettering in the coming days. “It’s very important for me to bring a smile to a child’s face this holiday season, especially ones in those circumstances,” Rubin, 17, told The Post. “I’ve been collecting toys all year to do this.” Liebowitz mentioned that another teen in Roslyn is also looking into creating a drive.

139,Chris Cuomo Says Biden Pardon ‘Gave Trump The Exact Baseball Bat’ To Justify Beating Dems ‘To Death’,"NewsNation host Chris Cuomo argued Tuesday that President Joe Biden’s pardon of his son Hunter has armed President-elect Donald Trump with ammunition to counter his own legal challenges. Biden, in his Sunday statement announcing the pardon, conceded his own Department of Justice (DOJ) has engaged in politically motivated actions, which Trump’s attorney cited in a motion Tuesday to dismiss his New York case. Cuomo, on “CUOMO,” described the pardon as a “gift” to Trump that he is already leveraging for his advantage. (RELATED: ‘He Lied To Us For A Long Time’: Elie Honig Says Hunter Biden Pardon Will ‘Tarnish’ Joe Biden’s Legacy) WATCH: “It took exactly one day for Trump and the funky bunch to seize on the gift that Biden just gave him. Democrats who are saying, ‘Oh, I can’t support Biden’s decision. This is about principle.’ Look, everyone gets protecting family except the cancel-crazy people, but this isn’t about that,” Cuomo said. “This is about how Biden justified this … This was a huge admission, what Biden said here.” “Who knew in the Democrat ranks that Biden was going to say he was pardoning his son not because it’s his son, not because he’s got to protect him, but because of political prosecutions and overreach? Who knew? People had to know,” he continued. “People had to know how dangerous this pardon was going to look.” Cuomo also speculated that Biden may pardon himself and his brother. “Who knows? Because clearly what Biden is trying to do is insulate all three of them from funny money probes. That’s why you bracket the ten-year period. It’s not how that usually works,” he said. “Usually, you say, ‘This is my son. This is what he was convicted of. He owns it. He pleaded guilty. That’s it. I’m letting him go. He’s my son. If you don’t like it, I’m on the way out anyway.’ You would have gotten that. Democrats could say, ‘No, no one’s above the law.’ Forget it. Nobody believes that.” Biden’s pardon for his son is “full and unconditional,” covering any crime he is charged with or “may have committed or taken part in” since 2014. “And yet he’s blaming his behavior in advance on a corrupt system. Tell me, who does he sound like? And that is the answer to why the Democrats lost — because he sounds just like the guy who’s supposed to be so much worse,” Cuomo said. “And the Democrats, protectors of the institutions, let it happen. You let a sitting president say, ‘The DOJ on my watch was dirty and how it went after my son.’ How do you let that happen?” “And in so doing, you have sealed our fate.

The article features Chris Cuomo's critical analysis of Biden's pardon for Hunter Biden, suggesting it empowers Trump politically and reflects poorly on Democrats. By emphasizing Biden's perceived missteps and the implications for the Democratic Party, the piece carries a critical tone towards Biden while also touching on broader issues relevant to Democrats. The focus on internal party critique and the portrayal of Biden's actions as a political liability leans the article towards a left-leaning bias while not being overtly extreme."
351,Southwest Distances Itself from DEI Hiring Programs after Pressure from Conservative Group,"Southwest Airlines is backing away from its diversity, equity, and inclusion hiring programs in response to legal action from a conservative organization. The Department of Labor sent conservative group America First Legal a letter Tuesday after the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs and Southwest held an informal conference to address the airline’s DEI hiring practices and America First Legal’s request for an investigation into alleged violations of federal contracting law. The letter confirmed that Southwest is aware of OFCCP regulations that prevent hiring preferences or quotas. Southwest agreed that its hiring benchmarks were not quotas, rather they were metrics to measure representation in its existing workforce. If Southwest fails to meet its diversity hiring benchmarks, the company’s representatives promised to find ways of expanding workforce diversity without transgressing civil rights law, the letter says. “Americans have had enough of corporations’ overt discrimination under the guise of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. It is unacceptable that corporations are so openly using everyday Americans’ hard-earned tax dollars to meet their unlawful race and sex quotas to achieve some ‘correct’ amount of diversity and representation,” said America First Legal counsel Will Scolinos America First Legal filed a complaint with the OFCCP in January requesting an investigation into Southwest’s hiring practices to determine whether they are violating anti-discrimination laws for government contractors. The complaint cites a Southwest corporate report from 2022 that touted its DEI hiring programs and the company’s demographic shifts. In 2022, 63 percent of Southwest’s 18,000 hires came from racially diverse backgrounds and 51 percent were women, boosting the airline’s racial and gender diversity. America First Legal was concerned that Southwest was using racial and gender quotas to achieve those numbers and bolster its commitment to DEI. The report celebrates Southwest’s “evolving” hiring practices and a requirement for diverse candidates to be eligible for leadership positions. According to America First Legal, the OFCCP investigation discovered a violation of anti-discrimination rules for government contractors, and the conference was held to sort out the issue. “Southwest Airlines will continue to recruit, hire, and retain a diverse and inclusive workforce in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. During an informal conference on Dec. 2, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) reiterated that Southwest should continue to abide by the regulations. OFCCP made no determination of any violations by the airline,” Southwest Airlines said in a statement. DEI programs are left-wing initiatives that typically focus on people’s immutable characteristics over their character and talent. Conservative groups have filed numerous legal challenges to DEI initiatives for alleged violations of civil rights law through the prioritization of certain identity groups over others. Some large corporations, especially those with red-state clientele, have walked back DEI activities in response to conservative pressure and the changing legal environment. The Supreme Court ruled last year that race-based college admissions policies are illegal under the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. Walmart is the most recent high-profile company to drop DEI programs because of political pressure with the incoming Trump administration expected to target DEI further. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to implement measures intended to roll pack progressive racial and gender policies common across American institutions.

This article demonstrates lean right bias as it primarily presents the viewpoint and actions of conservative groups opposing DEI hiring programs, framing them as necessary pushback against perceived discrimination. The language used suggests a criticism of DEI initiatives, associating them with unlawful practices and highlighting legal actions taken by conservative organizations.

131,House Republicans defeat Democratic resolution to release Gaetz report,"Democrats accuse Republicans of covering up damaging report on allegations. Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives shot down a resolution supported by Democrats to release a congressional report about accusations made against Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida. 206 members were against the resolution while 198 voted for the release of the report. One Republican voted for the release, Rep. Tom McClintock of California. 'That would open up Pandora's box and I don't think that's a healthy thing for the institution.' The report by the House Ethics Committee details accusations that Gaetz had sex with a minor and participated in illicit drug use. He has denied the allegations, and a federal investigation into the claims did not result in any charges against him. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana previously said he opposed the release of the report. ""I do not believe that that is an appropriate thing,"" he said. ""It doesn't follow our rules and traditions and there is a reason for that. That would open up Pandora's box and I don't think that's a healthy thing for the institution."" Democratic Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois lambasted Republicans for defeating his resolution. “Today, the majority of the House of Representatives took the easy way out,” he said. “They could have ensured a vote on whether or not former Members should be held accountable when they face serious and credible allegations of sexual misconduct, including having sex with minors. Instead, the House voted to sweep these allegations under the rug and set an unfortunate precedent that, if you are ever facing scrutiny, resigning from Congress can make your problems go away.""President-elect Donald Trump surprised many when he announced Gaetz as his pick for the U.S. Attorney's Office. Even some Republicans publicly decried the nomination and vowed that Gaetz would never be confirmed as the highest law enforcement official of the U.S. Gaetz eventually withdrew his nomination and thanked Trump for the nomination. ""While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the crucial work of the Trump/Vance Transition,"" Gaetz said at the time. ""There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General.""Gaetz had resigned from his seat following the nomination and left the office open. Trump went on to nominate Pam Bondi, a former Florida attorney general, to the office. Many opined that Bondi would pass Senate confirmation far easier than Gaetz would have. Like Blaze News?

359,Trump picks Fiserv CEO Frank Bisignano to lead Social Security Administration,"President-elect Donald Trump has selected Frank Bisignano, the CEO of financial services technology company Fiserv, to lead the Social Security Administration. Mr. Trump said Mr. Bisignano enjoys “a tremendous track record of transforming large corporations.” “He will be responsible to deliver on the Agency’s commitment to the American People for generations to come!” Mr. Trump posted late Wednesday on Truth Social. Fiserv is a giant payment and financial technology company used by banks, credit unions and other lenders. Mr. Trump said the company “touches almost every American household each day.” The Social Security Administration processes retirement, disability, survivor and family benefits. It also enrolls people in Medicare and provides Social Security numbers, a key government identifier. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley is the current administrator under President Biden. Mr. Bisignano previously served as co-chief operating officer at JPMorgan Chase & Co., and he is a founding board member of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. During the campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to preserve Social Security benefits and eliminate taxes on them. Mr. Trump’s sweeping tax promises might run into headwinds on Capitol Hill, however, particularly if his plans impact the program’s solvency.

What Trump’s economic picks could foretell for second administrationUnmuteLoading Ad 00:00/01:21 LIVE Top congressional Democrats are putting pressure on President Joe Biden to void student loan debt for hundreds of thousands of borrowers who were defrauded by predatory schools before the president leaves office. Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) held a press conference alongside a group of student loan activists on Wednesday calling on the Biden administration to act with urgency to issue debt relief to students who attended predatory schools or were harmed by school misconduct before the Trump administration takes over in January. “We are here to demand that the Department of Education deliver on President Biden’s commitment to debt relief and process all outstanding borrower defense relief before President Trump slams the door shut on borrowers on Jan. 20,” Markey said, standing alongside students holding up signs showing how much student debt they currently owe. “Borrowers who attended fraudulent schools and have struggled with debt for years or even decades cannot afford to wait any longer,” he added. The three lawmakers sent a letter signed by over 70 members of Congress to the Department of Education, urging the Biden administration to make good on their prior commitment to issue relief to students “who attended institutions with documented histories of predatory practices; and processing any outstanding borrower defense applications.” Department of Education Bor… by web-producers The Biden Administration issued forgiveness for borrowers who attended collapsed for-profit institutions in 2022, including Corinthian Colleges, and ITT Technical Institutes, among several others. However, many borrowers who were approved for forgiveness are still waiting for relief. At least 145,000 former Corinthian students who were approved for a discharge still have not received student loan forgiveness, according to the Project on Predatory Student Lending. The lawmakers want the administration to finish discharging the debt for those who have already been approved for student loan forgiveness in addition to expanding relief to others who were also defrauded by their schools. The trio specifically urged the Education Department to issue forgiveness for “students who the Department has already committed to providing borrower defense debt relief.” The lawmakers demanded the department utilize its authority under the Higher Education Act to forgive student loans for borrowers “who attended other institutions with documented histories of predatory practices” and process “any remaining applications for borrower defense discharge.” Forgiving student loans associated with schools that the Department has already committed to providing borrower defense may be possible. However, the other requests may be a heavy lift after the program remains tied up in litigation after a federal court issued an injunction last year. According to the federal government’s student aid office, “the injunction is effective” until a final judgment in the case has been made. “The Department will not adjudicate any borrower defense applications under the rule subject to the injunction unless and until the injunction is lifted,” the agency said, while still encouraging borrowers to apply for the borrower defense relief. Biden’s largest effort at loan forgiveness was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2023, which ruled the sweeping forgiveness plan exceeded his legal authority. “What can happen is this president steps up and says, ‘we’re going to clear the books to these students’ and give them a new opportunity in life. He can do it, we want him to do it,” Durbin said during the press conference. “We’re going to tell him it has to be done before he leaves office.” Lawmakers believe that the incoming Trump administration will not make student loan forgiveness for borrowers defrauded by their schools a priority and may even take steps to undo initiatives Biden put into place to forgive student loan debt. Under Trump’s last term, the Department of Education put into place new regulations for the Borrower Defense to Repayment program that put into place new restrictions and increased the burden of proof for applicants.

79,Scandals Are Sinking Some of Trump’s Cabinet Picks. But a Big Question Remains for the Senate.,"Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Defense Department, has spent his week crisscrossing Senate office buildings as he tries to save his nomination. The scent is one of desperation. The revelation of a Monterey, California, police report into a rape allegation against Hegseth in 2017—he was not charged—was only the beginning, as subsequent reports have offered additional looks into his alleged drinking and womanizing. His confirmation now has a serious math problem in the Senate, and members of Trump’s team—who feel as if their nominee has not been particularly up front with them about his past—are floating replacement names in the press. When a nominee puts his mother on Fox News to explain that contrary to what you read in the news, she thinks her son is great, the nomination could be deep into its twilight. After Trump’s initial Cabinet picks were stocked with more traditional selections, like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio to lead the State Department, Hegseth was the first in a slew of controversial nominations. Within a matter of days, Trump had nominated Hegseth, a veteran and Fox News host, to run a life-and-death department with about 3 million employees and a nearly $1 trillion annual budget; Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, a widely disliked legislative pyromaniac, to lead the Department of Justice; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the most famous purveyor of public health misinformation in the country, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services; and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, an apologist for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, to oversee the intelligence community. These picks, along with Trump’s insistence that Senate leadership candidates support his use of recess appointments—in other words, the Senate’s abdicating its prerogative to advise and consent on nominees—suggested at first that Trump might have been trying to bend Senate Republicans to his will by making them swallow the unswallowable. It was as if he had compiled a list of human beings most likely to give Maine Sen. Susan Collins the vapors and sorted high-ranking executive positions from there. But breaking the Senate, as amusing as it might be, would be a time-consuming expenditure of political capital, and Trump has much he wants to get done in a short period of time. Spending his first months in office squeezing Gaetz and his ethics reports through a keyhole wasn’t worth the effort when a friendly neighborhood Pam Bondi was available. Similarly, as he could be thinking now, why waste months reliving an evening on the Monterey peninsula when there’s fun to be had serving as Ron DeSantis’ direct boss? The standard for imperiling scrutiny, so far, has been set at scandal. (Fresh scandal at that. Kristi Noem, Trump’s pick to run Homeland Security, was wise to reveal her dog execution months ago.) Senate Republicans don’t want to vote for someone in the midst of nonstop negative stories, and Trump has little patience for the scandals that compete with his own. But scandal wasn’t at the root of what made either Gaetz or Hegseth controversial. I was in the Capitol when the Gaetz selection was announced, and the universal, bipartisan reaction of holy shit wasn’t because everyone’s first thought was of Gaetz’s pending ethics report. It was because he was Matt Gaetz, whose name was synonymous in the building with unseriousness. Hegseth’s nomination was a head-scratcher well before a police report came along. It was met with bafflement at why a provocative television host was being tapped to run the Pentagon. What’s sinking them, instead, was that the scandals compounded the preexisting misgivings about people whom Trump enjoys watching on TV running two of the most powerful arms of the federal government. What we don’t know yet—and may not know until confirmation hearings are conducted early next year—is the extent to which enough Senate Republicans will protest the remaining nominees they see as unfit, but who aren’t freshly scandalized enough to offer an excuse for rejection. Gabbard doesn’t have any police or ethics reports in the hopper, as best we know. She just has a lot of excuses for revanchist Russian aggression. It has been years—years—since Kennedy did anything untoward to an animal corpse. The issue is with his view on vaccines, or chemtrails, or wireless cellular networks, or what have you. And the issue with our latest entrant—would-be FBI Director Kash Patel—isn’t that he had a debauched weekend recently. It’s that Trump has nominated to run the federal government’s law-enforcement agency a guy who literally published a list of targets for retribution. To once again bring the world’s lowest bar down another notch: It’s nice that there’s still a line, somewhere, for the chamber of Congress given constitutional oversight over high-level executive branch personnel. It’s still too early to know where that line will finally settle. Right now, “active scandal” is the level at which it’s appropriate to ask questions and work behind the scenes for a new nominee. What if Senate Republicans don’t like someone’s views or just think they’re unqualified? Is that still good enough for a “no” vote?",SLATE,Left,838,"Lean Left  
The article critiques several of Trump’s Cabinet picks, emphasizing allegations and controversies surrounding them. It employs a skeptical tone towards the nominees and suggests that the Senate might reject them based on ethics concerns and competence.

155,Suspended Texans Linebacker Wears Cleats Featuring Hamas Propaganda,"Suspended Houston Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair wore cleats with various pieces of Hamas propaganda on them when he launched into the illegal hit that took out Jacksonville Jaguars star QB Trevor Lawrence.During Sunday’s game against the Jaguars, the Texans player was wearing shoes with a message proclaiming “Free Palestine,” the Washington Free Beacon reported. The message “FREE” was written on one side of the cleats in the colors of the Palestinian flag. His shoes also contained a quote from the Quran and a message that stated “at least 41,788 Palestinians killed,” a statistic taken directly from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry, the Beacon noted.The cleats are part of the league’s “My Cause My Cleats” campaign, in which players can raise money for their various causes. In Al-Shaair’s case, the money raised would go to the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, according to the Houston Texans website. He began wearing the cleats last year, following the horrific Hamas attack on October 7 that left 1,200 Israelis killed.The relief fund’s partnerships with Hamas-linked groups has also brought increased scrutiny, according to NGO Monitor.AdvertisementFollowing the hit on Sunday, Al-Shaair was ejected from the game — and the quarterback was left lying on the ground with a concussion. The hit resulted in a crazy on-field fight between several players on both teams and the immediate ejection of the Texans player. The league followed up by giving Al-Shaair a three-game suspension.CHECK OUT THE DAILY WIRE HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDEThe NFL’s vice president of policy and rules administration, Jon Runyan, announced that the league had deemed the hit “unacceptable” and that the Texans player’s “continued disregard” for rules governing player safety “will not be tolerated,” ESPN reported.Advertisement“You were involved in a play that the [NFL] considers unacceptable and a serious violation of the playing rules,” Runyan wrote. “Video shows you striking the head/neck area of Jaguars’ quarterback Trevor Lawrence after he clearly goes down in a feet-first slide. … You led with your forearm and helmet and delivered a forceful blow to the head/neck area of your opponent when you had time and space to avoid such contact.”The Texans player later apologized to Lawrence but hit back at critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.“To the rest of the people who I’ve been called every single name in the book from reporters with their hands ready for a story to find their villain, to racist and Islamophobic fans and people, you don’t know my heart nor my character which I don’t need to prove to any of you,” Al-Shaair wrote, while he captioned his message “All Praise to Allah.”Advertisement",DailyWire,Right,431,"Lean Left

57,"On its way out, the Biden administration renews a push for airline-consumer protections","The Biden administration said Thursday it will take steps toward requiring airlines to pay cash compensation and cover lodging and meals for passengers who are stranded when an airline causes flights to be canceled or changed. The Biden administration said Thursday it will take steps toward requiring airlines to pay cash compensation and cover lodging and meals for passengers who are stranded when an airline causes flights to be canceled or changed. Such a rule would go far beyond the current requirement for airlines to pay ticket refunds. It would make U.S. policy more closely resemble airline consumer protections in Europe. But with less than seven weeks until President Joe Biden leaves office, the fate of additional regulations on airlines will be left in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. The industry trade group Airlines for America said the Biden administration’s proposal would drive up ticket prices. “In this highly competitive industry, carriers don’t need further incentive to provide quality service,” the group said in a statement. “This proposal is simply one in a long string of ill-conceived and rushed rules from an administration intent on reregulating the U.S. airline industry.” Biden’s Transportation Department said it will seek public comment on requiring airlines to pay cash compensation — starting at $200 — when a flight is canceled or significantly delayed because of a mechanical problem with the plane or an airline computer outage. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said his department is considering new passenger protections at this late date because air travel is breaking records. The Transportation Department runs an online “dashboard” that lists each airline’s promise around customer service when they cause flights to be canceled or severely late. However, passengers must usually ask for help at the airport, and airline promises don’t carry the weight of federal rules. The department said it is considering cash compensation that could go as high as $775 for delays of nine hours or more. The agency is considering letting small airlines pay less compensation than large ones. The proposal will likely include free rebooking on the next available flight, possibly on another airline, and meals and lodging when passengers are stranded overnight. Many of the largest U.S. airlines already promise that kind of help when a delay or cancellation is their fault. The administration will seek public comment on how to distinguish cancellations or delays that are within an airline’s control with those that are not. Buttigieg said Thursday that a compensation rule would discourage airlines from causing delays and make them take care of passengers when problems occur. Buttigieg said on MSNBC that protections for airline consumers enjoy bipartisan support in Congress — that was on display this week during a Senate hearing on airline fees — and that Trump campaigned on populist themes. “One important test of that will be to see if the next administration follows through on what we have initiated and maintains the rules that we have created and the enforcement practices that we have created to hold airlines accountable,” he said.",APNEWS,Left,506,"Lean Left  
The article primarily focuses on the Biden administration's consumer protection initiatives in the airline industry, portraying them positively and as necessary. It highlights government action in favor of passenger rights and presents the initiatives as progressive measures that challenge the status quo. The use of positive language regarding the Biden administration and its efforts, along with citing criticisms from the airline industry without equal weight from supporting arguments, indicates a leaning towards a Left perspective."
358,"Boston City Council Votes Unanimously to Retain Sanctuary Status, ‘Braces’ for Trump’s Immigration Policies","The Boston City Council voted unanimously to retain its status as a sanctuary city on Wednesday night, to “protect” illegal immigrants from president elect Donald Trump’s immigration policy. All thirteen council members voted to reaffirm the city’s Boston Trust Act, which “delineates the distinct roles and responsibilities of the Boston Police Department from those of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), thereby promoting trust between local law enforcement and immigrant communities.” In other words, the act severely limits to what extent local authorities can work with federal immigration authorities. “It’s not just a policy, but it is a promise to our immigrant neighbors that they are welcome here, and this is a safe haven, and they don’t have to live in fear of being unjustly scrutinized or even ripped away from their families,” Councilor Gabriela Coletta Zapata said at the Wednesday City Council meeting. “As we brace for impact, we’ve got to make sure that we all work together.” ICE’s Boston office repeatedly asks authorities in Massachusetts sanctuary cities to aid in removing criminal illegal immigrants, and it is repeatedly denied, usually due to laws such as the Trust Act which allow cities to shield immigrants from federal authorities. In 2022, the Boston Police Department ignored twelve ICE detainer requests, per the Boston Trust Act. In Boston in early November, ICE arrested Mateo Hincapie Cardona, an illegal immigrant charged with multiple child sex offenses, who had been previously arrested by the Boston Police Department. Local authorities did not honor the detainer ICE issued for Cardona and instead released the man from their custody. Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities, of which Massachusetts has eight, and initiate mass deportations of illegal immigrants. Trump’s incoming “border czar” Tom Homan has sparred in recent weeks with progressive Boston mayor Michelle Wu over the city’s immigration policies. “Mayors’ number one responsibility is to protect their communities and that’s exactly what we’re going to do. So either she helps us or she gets the hell out of the way because we’re going to do it,” Homan said last month. Wu has said in response to Homan’s orders that “the idea that certain local law enforcement agencies will be required, or will be expected, to participate in mass deportations of residents who have not been part of serious criminal activity just to fulfill this campaign promise, this is not something that is possible under the laws in Boston.” Send a tip to the news team at NR.",NationalReview,Lean Right,416,"Lean Left  
The article presents a pro-sanctuary city perspective, emphasizing the Boston City Council’s unanimous decision to protect undocumented immigrants and framing it positively as a measure to foster trust within immigrant communities. It highlights statements from liberal officials while portraying opposing views, particularly from Trump and ICE, in a critical light. This emphasis on immigrant protection and critique of federal immigration policies indicates a lean towards left-wing values in the context of immigration."
20,'No one elected her': GOP infighting ensues over Trump’s legislative plans,"Republican lawmakers are split over major policy bills influenced by President-Elect Donald Trump's priorities — immigration, taxes, and energy — which new Senate leader John Thune (R-SD) said earlier this week he wants to push through within the first 30 days of Trump's presidency. The GOP lawmakers are planning to use a reconciliation bill — which allows for bypassing Democratic votes — in order to successfully pass the legislation. However, Politico reports: A number of House Republicans, including committee chairs key to pulling off the plan, are already raising red flags over the strategy, saying they don’t feel the need to stick to that. The disconnect illustrates the challenge that Republican leaders will have next term: They can preach unity, but they have no room for error as they wrangle at-times raucous members with varied priorities. READ MORE: New Senate GOP leader plans push for 'major partisan bills' in Trump’s first 30 days: report According to the news outlet, ""House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan(R-Ohio) pointed to pushback from Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.), adding that: 'We’ve got members who have some concerns.'"" Thune told Politico, ""We have to all be on the same page."" He added, “Sometimes it’s challenging because you’ve got to have a House, Senate and White House all pulled in the same direction."" Far-right Freedom Caucus member Rep. Chip Roy (Texas) said, ""I remain of the belief that we ought to deliver very quickly on a reconciliation package that has core tenets of the things we want to accomplish in terms of border and fees and so forth, IRA repeal, then some elements of tax policy.

Trump’s union strategy, including pro-labor nominee vs. mixed signalsUnmuteLoading Ad 00:00/03:08 LIVE General Motors told shareholders on Wednesday that it would record more than $5 billion in two non-cash charges in the fourth quarter due to ailing business in China, causing the automaker to make fewer models and close down manufacturing plants. GM will reduce its joint-venture value with China’s state-owned SAIC Motor by $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion, and the automaker estimates restructuring costs will be $2.7 billion. The Detroit-based automaker partners with SAIC to produce Buick, Cadillac, and Chevrolet vehicles. General Motors Chairman and CEO Mary Barra speaks about the financial outlook of the automaker on Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017, in Detroit, Michigan. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) In the first three quarters of this year, GM lost about $350 million throughout the region, and in March, SAIC planned to cut thousands of jobs, including within its joint venture with GM. In October, GM CEO Mary Barra told investors there would be “a significant reduction in dealer inventory and modest improvements in sales and share” by the end of the year. “The operating environment in China continues to be challenging and there is more hard work to do with our partner,” Barra said. Chinese automakers such as BYD have become more dominant than automakers such as GM and Volkswagen as they have met the increased demand for more electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. While GM-SAIC sold only 370,989 units in the first 11 months of 2024, a sales decrease of 59%, BYD sold more than 10 times the number of cars in the same period. GM’s shares were down 2.7% after its announcement on Wednesday, but prior to President-elect Donald Trump‘s Mexico–Canada tariff announcement in November, GM’s shares were up 49%. GM’s shares fell 7% on Nov. 26 after Trump posted his tariff declaration, as the proposed tariffs threaten GM’s five Mexico-based manufacturing plants. China’s increased success is a warning sign for automakers and politicians alike as the likelihood of BYD moving production into Mexico to export products into the U.S. grows. Last year, BYD bought an abandoned Ford Motor manufacturing base in Brazil, taking the first step in moving its production into Latin America. In November, BYD said it was considering building a manufacturing plant in Mexico, according to the Wall Street Journal. About 10% of new cars sold in Mexico are Chinese brands, making it a prime location to set up shop and export to the U.S. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Even with China’s auto dominance, GM hopes to continue its SAIC partnership to revive sales in the country and compete again with Chinese companies such as BYD. During Wednesday’s investors meeting, GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said that throughout 2025, the company is going to work toward gaining profitability in China again.",WashingtonExaminer,Lean Right,703,"Center

26,Legislators propose 15% to 25% tax rate for new states adopting internet gambling,"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Lawmakers from states where gambling is legal are proposing standards for additional states that are considering allowing internet gambling, including a tax rate of 15% to 25%, and a ban on credit card deposits. The National Council of Legislators from Gaming States issued model legislation last week for states that are weighing whether to permit internet gambling. The proposal will be discussed at the group’s winter meeting in New Orleans next week. It is designed to give them a framework around which to build their own legislation while incorporating things that have been working well in other states. Seven U.S. states currently offer legal online casino games: Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia. Nevada offers internet poker but not online casino games. “Many states have been discussing this, but were having a hard time getting it across the finish line,” said Shaun Fluharty, a West Virginia Democratic state delegate who serves as president of the national legislators group. “We’re trying to put together some best practices for them.” The proposed legislation is modeled closely on laws that have been operating in states including New Jersey, which has been a leader in approving and regulating internet gambling since 2013. David Rebuck, the retired head of New Jersey’s Division of Gaming Enforcement, advised the lawmakers’ group on the proposed legislation. “Ninety-five percent of this mirrors what we’re already doing in New Jersey, which is good,” he said. “It’s a great start that builds on what is already in place and operational elsewhere.” It calls for strict oversight of internet gambling to protect consumers and weed out unsavory individuals and companies. The proposal also calls for the establishment of a government agency to regulate online wagering if one does not already exist. It would limit deposits to $20,000 in any 24-hour period and prohibit the use of credit cards to fund gambling accounts. A suggested tax rate of 15% to 25% is a starting point for discussions, Fluharty said. That range is above what some states charge, but far less than others, such as Pennsylvania, which taxes online sports betting at 36% and online slot machine games at 54%. Fluharty said the national average for online gambling tax rates is 19%. West Virginia taxes them at 15%. “The thinking was we didn’t want to form a barrier to entry into the market with a high tax rate that only the biggest companies could afford,” he said. Fluharty said Maryland has been trying to enact internet gambling, which made it through the House but not the Senate in April. He also said other states including Ohio and Louisiana have been considering their own online gambling measures. New York lawmakers have been trying to enact online casino gambling with a 31.5% tax rate without success but did allow online sports betting. Rebuck predicted that more states will give internet gambling a serious look in the new year as budget pressures mount. “A number of states are being cautious about their budgets, and if they’re looking at this as a potential revenue driver, it’s pretty significant,” he said. New Jersey’s 13% tax on online sports betting and 15% tax on online casino games brought in over $414 million in tax revenue last year. It has nearly matched that figure through just the first 10 months of this year. The group’s proposal does not attempt to set national standards. Gambling is largely regulated by states, and sporadic attempts to enact nationwide laws on it have gone nowhere in recent years. President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly said he favors letting states decide important questions. During his first term as president, Trump did not act to impose nationwide regulations on the gambling industry of which he once was a member, with three casinos in Atlantic City.

314,Republican Senator Ernst does not yet back Trump Pentagon pick Hegseth,"WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a combat veteran and sexual assault survivor, said on Thursday she is not yet ready to back Pete Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense, dimming the confirmation hopes of President-elect Donald Trump's embattled nominee. Ernst, a senior Armed Services Committee member, said she had not yet gotten to ""yes"" on the nomination and wanted more investigation of allegations against him, after a lengthy discussion with Hegseth during their meeting on Wednesday. ""I think you are right,"" Ernst said in an interview on Fox News, when asked whether she had got to ""yes"" yet. ""I think for a number of our senators, they want to make sure that any allegations have been cleared. And that's why we have to have a very thorough vetting process."" Another Republican committee member, U.S. Senator Mike Rounds, praised Hegseth after their meeting on Thursday but told reporters he has more to do. ""I want him to be able to answer, in front of everybody else, the questions that are there,"" Rounds said. Republicans will hold a 53-47 Senate majority next year, meaning Hegseth could afford to lose the support of just three Republicans and still be confirmed if Democrats unite against him as expected. Hegseth insisted he would keep fighting for the position as he faced continuing concerns about allegations of misconduct in his professional and personal life. ""I will answer all of these senators' questions, but this will not be a process tried in media. I don't answer to anyone in this group. None of you. Not to that camera, at all,"" the former Fox News host told reporters at a Senate office building where he was meeting with Republican lawmakers. He said he is in the running as long as Trump wants him. Hegseth, 44, is an Army National Guard veteran who served in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and has two Bronze Stars. He has been criticized for lacking management experience needed to lead 1.3 million active-duty service members and the nearly 1 million civilians who work for the military. A person familiar with the confirmation process said the meeting between Ernst and Hegseth had been productive, with the discussion focused on issues including readiness and eliminating waste. Hegseth has the strong support of many of Trump's fellow Republicans, who will control the Senate starting in January. ""Pete is focused on what I’m focused on which is getting wokeness out of the military and making our Department of Defense lethal again,"" Senator-elect Jim Banks said in a statement after their meeting on Thursday. A wave of media reports has raised questions about Hegseth, including allegations of heavy drinking and allegations made in a police report that he sexually assaulted a woman in 2017 at a conference in California. No charges were filed, and he entered into a private settlement with the alleged victim. Hegseth's past statements also have worried some lawmakers. He has expressed disdain for so-called ""woke"" policies of Pentagon leaders, opposed women in combat roles and questioned whether the top American general was in his position because of his skin color.",Reuters,Center,523,"Center  
The article presents a straightforward account of Republican Senator Joni Ernst's hesitance to support President-elect Trump's nominee, Pete Hegseth, for the Department of Defense. It includes quotes from both Ernst and other Republican senators, as well as mentioning controversies surrounding Hegseth without overtly negative or supportive language. The presence of both criticisms and support from within the party reflects a neutral reporting style typical of center-leaning journalism, focusing on facts rather than opinion."
385,Why Asian Americans Are Moving Right,"The 2024 election season featured an unprecedented number of Asian Americans, from Vivek Ramaswamy’s rise in the Republican primary to soon-to-be second lady Usha Vance, to the Democratic candidate herself, Kamala Harris. Just a few years ago, this would have been a cause for celebration on the political left: Asian Americans have reliably voted for Democrats for decades. But the election results revealed that racial and ethnic minorities are not as loyal to the Democratic Party as previously believed. Much like Hispanics, Asian American voters made a major shift to the right.Nationally, 2020 and 2024 exit polls from The Washington Post show a 5-point shift to the Republicans in the presidential race among Asian American voters relative to 2020. In some states, such as Nevada and Texas, the polls suggest that Donald Trump won the Asian American vote outright. The NBC News exit poll found a 5-point shift to the right nationally among Asian Americans relative to 2020. And in their survey of Asian American voters prior to the election, Asian Americans Advancing Justice saw a 7-point shift away from the Democrats relative to 2020.Exit polls are far from perfect measures of voting behavior, though. A spokesperson for APIAVote, a group that focuses on encouraging Asian American political engagement, pointed out when asked for comment that the exit polls may not be a “representative sample of the Asian American electorate.” For instance, the exit polls were not conducted in any Asian languages, which would preclude some Asian American voters with poor English skills from participating.My analysis of precinct-level voting data in four major urban areas shows that the exit polls may actually be understating the degree to which Asian Americans shifted to the right. Using census data, I identified majority-Asian precincts in these areas and compared the Republican margin of victory (or loss) between the 2024 and 2020 elections. The results are much more stark: Majority-Asian precincts in New York City, for instance, saw a rightward shift of 31 percentage points. Precincts in Dallas and Fort Bend counties in Texas both saw rightward shifts between 17 and 20 points. And precincts in Chicago saw a 23-point shift to the right.If the rightward shift among Asian American voters is real and significant, what is behind it?

The article discusses the notable shift of Asian American voters towards the Republican Party, which suggests an analytical perspective that leans towards conservative viewpoints. It emphasizes this trend without particularly critiquing the Republican Party, while also acknowledging potential biases in exit polls. The data presented indicates a significant rightward shift, which aligns with a more favorable view of Republican results.

49,The most expensive US property for sale is a mere $295m – and likely to flood,"A sprawling Florida mansion set beside a powdery white sand beach overlooking the azure Gulf of Mexico is currently the most expensive property listed for sale in the United States, yours for a mere $295m. It is also in one of the most vulnerable places in the country to climate-driven disasters, and faces an almost inevitable flooding event in the coming years. The nine-acre gated retreat in Naples – styled as “Florida’s most exclusive compound” and complete with two vast guest houses, a dock, a yacht berth and facing water on three sides – stands as an extravagant symbol of how the desire for a balmy Florida lifestyle is colliding with the climate crisis. “It’s almost a certainty this property will experience a flood,” said Jeremy Porter, climate risk researcher at First Street Foundation, a non-profit flood analysis group. According to First Street modeling, the $295m Gordon Pointe property has a 68% risk of flooding in the next 15 years and an almost guaranteed 95% chance of a flood over the next three decades. Its flood exposure is “severe” and its risk from winds is “extreme” according to climate threat ratings that now appear on Zillow property listings. “It is a beautiful area, people here want access to the water and the beaches but it’s extremely exposed to flooding,” Porter said. “These are basically properties built on water.” The pricey Gordon Pointe enclave was owned by the late financier John Donahue, who died in 2017, and his wife, Rhodora, and is now being sold by the family trust. It sits at the tip of the exclusive Naples neighborhood of Port Royal, which consists of low-lying, thin fingers of land carved by canals that dangle from the southern end of the city. Mangroves, marshes and protective sand dunes have been swept aside here so multimillion-dollar developments can sit as close as possible to the sea, which is 6in higher than it was in the 1990s and is accelerating upwards due to the burning of fossil fuels. The threat to this idyll has been starkly illustrated by the five hurricanes that have rattled the western flank of Florida in just the last two years, most destructively with 2022’s Hurricane Ian and, more recently, the rapid one-two punch of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Naples has seen its streets inundated, its homes torn apart and its pier wrecked by storms turbocharged by an overheated Gulf. “There has been building right out on to the beach, we are very low-lying, we don’t have good dune fortifications now and no one really thought about storm surge here until Ian happened,” said Michael Savarese, a geology and climate expert at Florida Gulf Coast University, about Naples’ exposure. “The entire region is highly vulnerable to nuisance flooding and storm surge and if we keep having storms like the last two years there’s no time to catch our breath.” This vulnerability has led to a jarring situation where the glittering crown jewel property in a destination state with booming population growth is threatened by climate-fueled disaster like few other places in the US. “They are just buying time, borrowed time,” Savarese said of the string of opulent homes in Port Royal. “We are following the more extreme curve of sea level rise and nuisance flooding is going to be even more of a concern at every high tide. We haven’t addressed this well and we have been caught with our pants down.” There may still be willing buyers for luxury properties along the Florida coastline but the climate crisis is increasingly rubbing up against the prevailing trend of hordes of Americans, many of them retired, pouring into the state for the promise of warm weather and no state taxes. Home insurance rates in Florida, already the steepest in the US, rose by another 42%, on average, last year. Amid a cavalcade of disasters, at least a dozen insurers have fled Florida and a state backstop insurance system is now “not solvent” according to Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor. DeSantis, meanwhile, has responded to this new era by deleting mention of climate change in state laws. In Naples, this has meant that a city-drafted climate change vulnerability assessment had to be rewritten to remove the words “climate change” before it could be used to request state funding for upgrades to key facilities such as the stormwater system, so it doesn’t overflow into the streets during high tides. “I just roll with it,” said Natalie Hardman, natural resources manager at the city of Naples, about this make-believe world she has to contend with. “It’s the game we play, I guess.” Faced by fiercer storms and increasingly withering heat, Naples has tried to keep the water at bay by shoring up critical infrastructure and adding resilient design requirements for buildings, while also mopping up post-storm debris. “Unfortunately, we are getting a lot of practice at this,” Hardman said of the clean-ups. “The hurricanes are coming with more frequency, we are learning lessons from each of them. At times it can feel very overwhelming but we are thinking ahead and trying to stop issues before they start.” At a certain level of wealth such concerns can appear trivial. The grandest homes in Naples are stoutly built to withstand wind and many have their own pop-up flood barriers or seawalls, even if surrounding streets still fill with water and sand creating “island homes sitting in wasteland”, as Savarese put it. Port Royal was established in the 1940s as the “the finest place in the world to live” and the main Gordon Pointe mansion – a hefty 22,800 sq ft in size with six bedrooms and 24 bathrooms – strives to meet this ambition with a craftsmanship designed to withstand all a supercharged nature can throw at it. “This home was built with incredible building materials, it has almost indestructible qualities,” said Katherine Frattarola, who runs HUB Private Client, an insurance advisory service for wealthy individuals. Getting insurance for the property would “be very, very expensive; seven figures annually”, she added, but someone able to spend a third of a billion dollars on a single home is “in a very different strata”. Such a person “isn’t really thinking about risk. They are thinking about how much they love Naples and, frankly, having the most expensive home in America,” Frattarola said. “They can afford any repairs easily.” But those not in the billionaire class are starting to wince at the mounting cost of paradise, with clients able to spend $5m to $10m on a beach house now starting to eye the Carolinas or coastal Georgia instead for their purchases, Frattarola said. “We are increasingly having more conversations about ring fencing assets to pay for personalized insurance premiums,” she said. “It’s now, ‘Oh, shoot, I have to find insurance and pay for it?’ People are starting to look at different geographies.” Most Americans, of course, live far more modestly than this and often struggle to recover from a major disaster, even if they can meet insurance premiums that have rocketed in recent years. As storms scour the coasts of low-income people, those wealthy enough to cocoon themselves beside the beaches may be the last left here, until the tides completely swallow south-west Florida. “The high climate risk areas have the richest people so it’s worth thinking about who the beneficiaries are when we subsidize flood insurance,” said Parinitha Sastry, a finance expert at Columbia Business School who has researched the fragility of Florida’s insurance market. “It’s possible we see a sort of climate segregation due to risk-based pricing but the alternative is that we have a lot of vulnerable people in risky areas facing continual shocks,” she said. “Houses are a primary source of wealth so without that price signal you are making lower-income people even more vulnerable to losses to their main asset.” The next hurricane is less likely to deliver such a life-altering jolt to the new owner of Gordon Pointe. Whoever buys the compound, secluded at the end of the peninsula with only the waves as neighbors, will be untroubled even by people: “There’s no traffic going by, no one is looking in your window,” as a promotional video puts it, calling the development a “rare and exceptional property”. The real estate firm selling the property didn’t respond to questions about its climate risk. But is it, or any house, actually worth $295m? “A banana stuck onto a canvas can sell for $6.2m,” said Frattarola, referencing an eye-catching recent artwork sale. “If someone is willing to pay that for that then I suspect there are buyers for anything, at all sorts of prices.”",TheGuardiadn,Left,1438,"Lean Left  
The article highlights the luxury of a $295 million mansion while emphasizing its vulnerability to climate change impacts, which aligns with a left-leaning perspective that advocates for awareness of climate issues and social disparities. The criticism of Florida's response to climate change and wealth disparity suggests an inclination towards progressive viewpoints. The focus on environmental concerns and the social implications of wealth indicates a bias that leans left, though it does not fully embrace extreme left ideologies."

More Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images ""Right now, there are hundreds of billions of dollars flowing out the door of all of those programs ending up in the hands of people who, even under the statute, should not be receiving those payments,"" Ramaswamy said.This is after Ramaswamy pledged to make ""mass reductions"" via the new department on Fox News.""We expect mass reductions,"" Ramaswamy told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures.' ""We expect certain agencies to be deleted outright.""He added: ""We expect mass reductions in force in areas of the federal government that are bloated... We expect massive cuts among federal contractors and others who are overbilling the federal government. I think people will be surprised by, I think, how quickly we're able to move.""Social Security and Medicare are already facing a funding crisis that could see the money necessary for full benefits run out by the mid-2030s if nothing changes.But because Trump campaigned with the support of those relying on Social Security and Medicare, there are unlikely to be major cuts just yet, said Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin.

Most of the public understands their taxpayer dollars are not being well spent,"" Ramaswamy said. ""Elon and I aren't in this for the credit.

The article presents information primarily from a perspective aligned with Republican viewpoints, particularly those of Vivek Ramaswamy and Donald Trump, regarding the efficiency of government programs and the need for budget cuts.

249,5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday,"U.S. stocks will have a shortened trading day Friday after the market was closed Thursday for Thanksgiving. Equities fell entering the holiday, as some investors appeared to trim their stakes in major tech names. Still, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are hovering shy of all-time highs. Wednesday offered some fresh clues about the policy path ahead for the Federal Reserve, as year-over-year inflation of 2.3% matched expectations and the central bank’s latest meeting minutes indicated it plans to gradually cut interest rates if price increases continue to moderate. Follow live market updates. As shoppers scroll and head to stores to find the best Black Friday deals, some retailers are preparing for a better holiday than others. Forecasts have projected only modest holiday growth this year, and earnings reports so far suggest that spending may be going to some retailers more than others. Recent market winners like Walmart and Abercrombie & Fitch continued to see success entering the holiday season, while stragglers including Target and Kohl’s struggled. The 2024 presidential election could also play a role in what consumers buy this year. Voters who backed President-elect Donald Trump appear to have a better outlook for the economy than those who supported Vice President Kamala Harris, which could influence how much each group spends. Shipping data in the two weeks after the election also indicate red-state shoppers may have been opening their wallets more after Trump’s win. India’s economic expansion moderated during the country’s fiscal second quarter. Its economy grew by 5.4% during the period, below expectations and the slowest in nearly two years. Economists expect activity in the world’s most populous country will continue to moderate in 2025. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who are leading Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, will meet with Republican congressional leaders on Dec. 5. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said lawmakers plan to “discuss major reform ideas to achieve regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions, and cost savings” with the pair of entrepreneurs. While Musk and Ramaswamy have proposed massive cuts to the federal workforce and even the elimination of entire agencies, it remains to be seen how much influence they will have. – CNBC’s Alex Harring, Melissa Repko, Gabrielle Fonrouge, Lim Hui Jie, Matt Clinch and Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",CNBC,Center,381,"Center

Newly installed into Trump's proposed Department of Government Efficiency"" (DOGE), the tech entrepreneur, along with co-chair Elon Musk, have been making broad claims of eliminating trillions in government expenses without providing much in the way of messy details. On Thursday morning, host Scarborough introduced the clip of Ramaswamy speaking and, after admitting he is in favor of government cutbacks, bluntly said of the Trump's appointees proposals, ""This is a scam."" ""Steve, let's cut straight to this,"" Scarborough said to his guest. ""I know you're going to go through these charts, but his is something that you want to hear these two guys talking about: how they are going to cut $2 trillion from the budget."" ""It's a joke,"" he pronounced before adding, ""And it's a joke because this is something you and I have been obsessed about for very long time, the national debt, getting the deficit under control. Just looking at your first chart here, people need to understand, Social Security and Medicare make up about 50 percent of what the government spends. You add defense and veterans benefits, that's another 20 percent, you are up to 70 percent. You then add debt, and how much it costs to service that debt, that's another 10 percent."" ""So Steve, before they even start talking about cutting these so-called federal employees that are bankrupting us, the United States government has already spent 80 percent of its budget on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, vets, defense and interest on the debt,"" he added. ""I love some of these other numbers,"" he joked. ""Again, forgive me for killing Hamlet in the first act here: let's cut law enforcement, that's 1 percent of the budget., but let's cut sciences and medical research, we spend too much on that they may be saving 1 percent of the budget. ""Transportation, those barrel projects is going to bankrupt us, it's only 2% of the budget,"" he jokingly exclaimed. ""Again, I will actually let you explain this far better than I am right now, but this is a scam unless they are going to slash Social Security and Medicare and Veterans Affairs. They are never going to get the $2 trillion so they need to just stop pretending."" Watch below or at the link here.",AlterNet,Left,427,"Lean Left  
The article critiques the economic plan proposed by a Trump appointee, highlighting negative reactions from MSNBC hosts. It uses strong language like ""scam"" and ""joke"" to describe the plan, suggesting a clear disapproval of right-wing economic proposals. The focus on government efficiency appears to serve as a critique of conservative fiscal policy, which is characteristic of left-leaning media that often emphasize caution against austerity measures and the protection of social programs."
300,What Is France's No-Confidence Vote and What Does It Mean for the US?,"France's government, led by Prime Minister Michel Barnier, was ousted in a historic no-confidence vote on Wednesday, marking the first such collapse since 1962.The political upheaval, fueled by opposition to austerity measures in the 2025 budget, leaves France without a stable government and introduces significant uncertainty at home and abroad.President Emmanuel Macron, of the centrist Renaissance party, insisted he will serve the rest of his term until 2027. However, he will need to appoint a new prime minister for the second time after July's legislative elections led to a deeply divided parliament.The implications extend beyond French borders, with potential economic and geopolitical ramifications, especially for its allies, including the United States.

More Photo by AMAURY CORNU/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images What is a No-Confidence Motion?A no-confidence vote is a procedure in which lawmakers vote to express whether they have confidence in the government or a political leader.Barnier's minority government lost the vote on Wednesday, with a total of 331 out of 577 MPs from the left and right of the political spectrum uniting to support the motion. A majority of 288 votes was needed.The motion brought together an unlikely alliance between the left-wing New Popular Front and the far-right National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen, which is the largest single party in parliament.Losing the vote means that Barnier must hand in the resignation of his government.Who Could Be the Next Prime Minister of France?Following Barnier's ouster, Macron faces the urgent task of appointing a new prime minister who can secure support in a fragmented National Assembly. Speculation centers around candidates such as Sébastien Lecornu, the minister of armed forces, and François Bayrou, leader of the centrist MoDem party.The left-wing coalition has continued to advocate for Lucie Castets, an economist and civil servant. However, Castets' candidacy was dismissed by Macron earlier this year, and it remains unclear whether she could garner enough parliamentary support. Political experts suggest Macron may need to opt for a technocrat capable of navigating France through the impending budgetary crisis.

French Prime Minister Faces No-Confidence Vote After Austerity Budget ICC Chief Blasts US and Russia Over 'Appalling' Interference How Long Did Barnier Serve?Barnier's tenure as prime minister was short-lived, lasting less than three months. The former EU chief negotiator assumed office after a snap election in June resulted in a deeply polarized parliament. His downfall was precipitated by his decision to invoke Article 49.3 of the French Constitution, bypassing a parliamentary vote to push through a controversial 2025 budget. The move alienated far-right and far-left factions, uniting them in opposition.""This reality will not disappear by the magic of a motion of censure,"" Barnier told lawmakers ahead of the vote, warning that the fiscal deficit—projected at 6 percent of GDP—would remain a challenge for any future government.How Could the Government Collapse Impact the US?The instability in one of Europe's largest economies comes at a time of heightened geopolitical and economic tension. French financial markets have already experienced volatility, with bond yields rising and the euro under pressure.Economically, the upheaval could complicate the European Union's response to new trade tariffs expected from the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.""There are two major powers in Europe, France and Germany, both of which right now are emasculated,"" Nick Rees, a senior FX market analyst at Monex Europe, told Reuters. He added that this dynamic could weaken Europe's negotiating position with the U.S.Politically, France's instability could reduce its ability to collaborate on global challenges, including climate policy and NATO commitments. As Macron seeks to stabilize his government, analysts warn that a prolonged crisis could create a leadership vacuum in the EU, potentially straining U.S.-EU relations.Why Does France Have a President and Prime Minister?Barnier's ousting does not directly affect Macron's position as president, as the two have distinct roles under France's semi-presidential system.The president is elected by popular vote every five years, and the most recent one was in April 2022.The prime minister is appointed by the president, and their authority is primarily related to the government's day-to-day operations, while the president oversees broader national and foreign policy matters.",NewsWeek,Center,782,"Center

120,Elon Musk hints at how the DOGE will dismantle massive federal workforce,"The billionaire responded to a shocking statistic about federal workers' habits. Tech billionaire Elon Musk responded to a report showing how many federal workers actually show up for work in person and hinted at actions DOGE might take to lower the federal budget. The report found that only about 6% of the federal workforce reported in-person on a ""full-time basis"" while nearly a third of federal workers do their work remotely on a full-time basis. It also indicated that some workers were lying about where they were located in order to jack up their income based on locality pay schedules. 'That is absurd, and it’s not something the American people will stand for.' Musk responded to the report on X, the social media platform he owns. ""If you exclude security guards & maintenance personnel, the number of government workers who show up in person and do 40 hours of work a week is closer to 1%!"" he wrote. ""Almost no one.""Musk has been tasked as one of the two directors of the Department of Government Efficiency, the acronym of which is also a play on the cryptocurrency coin based on a popular dog meme. The other director is director Vivek Ramaswamy. The report on federal workers' habits was put together by the office of Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, who presented it to Musk and Ramaswamy during their visit to Congress on Thursday. Photographers captured Musk with his son on his shoulders walking through Congress. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana also responded to the report. “That is absurd, and it’s not something the American people will stand for,” said Johnson to reporters. “And so one of the first things that I think you’ll see is a demand from the new administration, from all of us in Congress, [that] the federal workers, return to their desks.” The report also found that the government was spending about $15.7 billion per year to lease and maintain federal office buildings. 7,697 of those were completely vacant while 2,265 were somewhat empty.

153,Biden Admits His DOJ Is Corrupt,"President Joe Biden admitted on Sunday that his Department of Justice (DOJ) is “infected” by politics. It’s an admission that’s entirely true — but not for the reasons Biden thinks. Biden issued a blanket pardon for his son Hunter for “offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024.” That means Hunter is off the hook for the federal gun and tax charges he was being prosecuted for, as well as other potential crimes he committed like FARA violations and money laundering. In explaining the unprecedented, decade-long pardon, Biden said he had no choice since the DOJ was corrupted by politics. “I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice — and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further,” Biden said. “I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.” Biden’s right, his DOJ is corrupt. Under his DOJ, U.S. Attorney David Weiss delayed bringing charges against Hunter despite ample evidence that Hunter failed to pay more than $1.4 million in taxes and lied about drug use on his federal form to purchase a firearm. Biden’s DOJ hand-crafted a sweetheart plea deal for Hunter that eventually derailed after a judge scrutinized the broad immunity it afforded Hunter. The DOJ, as explained by my colleague Jordan Boyd, “specifically choked an IRS investigation and subsequent charging recommendations for Hunter because they feared it would hurt Joe’s chances in the 2020 election.” All of that is corruption — corruption that only stood to benefit Hunter. But as far as victims of the Biden DOJ’s corruption goes, Hunter isn’t one of them. The DOJ’s Jack Smith indicted President-elect Donald Trump twice. One indictment centered around Trump’s questioning of the administration of the 2020 election. (The other was related to Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents.) After Smith dragged Trump through the mud and made a mockery of the so-called “justice” system, the Supreme Court torpedoed Smith’s lawfare efforts in July when it ruled that a U.S. president has “absolute immunity” for “actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority” and “at least presumptive immunity” for all “official acts.” Smith later filed a superseding indictment against Trump, refusing to let the case go because he thought it would hurt Trump’s chances of winning the election. Smith has since dropped the case after Trump’s victory. Biden’s politicized DOJ has also prosecuted nearly 1,500 Americans for protesting the 2020 election, with Attorney General Merrick Garland telling Americans in August to take the prosecutions as a warning about what would happen to them should they raise questions about an election. The DOJ also targeted a group of praying pro-lifers who decided to pray outside of an abortion clinic in the hope that their silent pleas would help save the life of an innocent child. Seven pro-lifers were found guilty of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act and engaging in a civil rights conspiracy for, as explained by The Federalist’s Beth Brelje, “standing and sitting in front of the door of the Northland Family Planning Clinic” in Michigan in 2020. The DOJ is corrupt and politicized, as Biden correctly pointed out. But the real victims of the DOJ’s perversion of justice are Trump and the American people, not Hunter Biden.",Federalist,Right,590,"Right  
The article critiques President Biden and his Department of Justice, emphasizing corruption while favorably portraying Donald Trump and his legal challenges. The use of terms like ""politicized"" and ""corrupt"" suggests a strong bias against the Biden administration. The focus on Hunter Biden's legal issues further reflects a right-leaning perspective, portraying him as a victim of an unfair system while neglecting the broader context of political and legal accountability."
263,Donald Trump Asked to Help Redraw Border Between US States,"The Greater Idaho Movement, which is campaigning for eastern and central counties of Oregon to secede from the state and join their neighbor, has written to President-elect Donald Trump requesting his support.In the letter, the group told Trump that ""the people here overwhelmingly voted for you,"" adding: ""We humbly ask you for your support in helping Eastern Oregonians achieve what the people have said they want, and that's to join Idaho.""Thus far, 13 Oregon counties have voted to leave the state and join Idaho, with the most recent, Crook County, doing so in May 2024. The Greater Idaho movement hopes they will be joined by Umatilla and Gilliam counties in full, along with Wasco and Deschutes counties in part. At this point, nearly the eastern two-thirds of Oregon would have voted to switch states.Advocates of the Greater Idaho proposal argue that the more conservative-leaning and sparsely populated counties of eastern and central Oregon are currently unfairly dominated by the big, mostly liberal-voting cities on the coast, such as Portland and Salem.The Greater Idaho Movement's letter, signed by its president Mike McCarter, vice president Sandie Gilson and executive director Matt McCaw, was sent to Trump on Wednesday.""We are excited to see the promise of your incoming administration for solving old political problems with new approaches,"" the letter said.""Unlike typical politicians, you have a unique ability as a practical problem-solver to get things done, and your support can bring a peaceful resolution to Oregon's longstanding east-west divide.""The letter noted Democrats have controlled the Oregon House, Senate and governor's office since 2007, arguing: ""With over 60% of the landmass, but only 9% of the population, eastern Oregon residents recognize that representative government will never come from Oregon because we are outvoted on every issue the progressives put forth.""McCarter, Gilson and McCaw concluded: ""Eastern Oregonians have spoken, and we yearn to join the family of small government and citizen-directed systems that Idahoans enjoy, but we need help from your administration to make this happen.""Newsweek reached out to the Trump transition team and the Greater Idaho Movement for comment via email and online inquiry form, respectively.

24,Hegseth fights to save Pentagon nomination as sources say Trump considers DeSantis,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A defiant Pete Hegseth fought to save his nomination to be Donald Trump’s defense secretary Wednesday as the president-elect considered possible replacements in the face of growing questions about the former Fox News host’s personal conduct and ability to win Senate confirmation. WASHINGTON (AP) — A defiant Pete Hegseth fought to save his nomination to be Donald Trump’s defense secretary Wednesday as the president-elect considered possible replacements in the face of growing questions about the former Fox News host’s personal conduct and ability to win Senate confirmation. Hegseth met with legislators on Capitol Hill, conducted a radio interview and released an opinion article denying allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking. He insisted he was “not backing down one bit,” said Trump was still supporting him and planned to return Thursday for more meetings with lawmakers. But the president-elect’s team was looking at alternatives, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Trump himself remained quiet about Hegseth while issuing a flurry of statements on social media Wednesday about other nominees and his news coverage. Hegseth, in an exchange with reporters, said he’d meet with Trump “anytime he’d like.” Trump’s team was pleased with how things went Wednesday as Hegseth met with lawmakers, according to a person familiar with their thinking, and they are continuing to stand behind him for now -- all while Trump considers back-up options. North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer, who had previously expressed concerns about reports of Hegseth’s drinking, spoke positively about Hegseth’s prospects after the two met Wednesday evening. “I see no reason at this point not to be supportive,” Cramer said. He said he told Hegseth “it’s really important that we have a clear eyed secretary of defense if the alarm goes off or the phone rings at three in the morning.” Hegseth responded, according to Cramer, that he would be available “at three in the morning, three in the afternoon or any hour in between.” Hegseth is the latest nominee-designate to be imperiled by personal baggage after the recent withdrawal of Trump’s initial pick for attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, whose vulnerabilities were well-documented. But Hegseth’s past, including the revelation that he made a settlement payment after being accused of a sexual assault that he denies, was not widely known. The Trump transition team went into the day concerned about Hegseth’s path to Senate confirmation and actively looking at potential replacements, a person familiar with the matter said. Three other people said DeSantis, who competed against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, was being discussed as an option if Hegseth’s nomination does not move forward. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations. Beyond DeSantis, there have also been discussions about shifting Michael Waltz, who was chosen by Trump for national security adviser, to the Defense Department, according to another person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Florida congressman is a retired Army National Guard officer and war veteran. As he made the rounds on Capitol Hill, Hegseth told reporters he had received a fresh message of support from Trump. “I spoke to the president this morning. He supports me fully. We’re not going anywhere,” Hegseth said. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, Hegseth laid out a vigorous defense of his record, including his time spent at two veterans advocacy groups, Concerned Veterans for America and Veterans For Freedom. In new allegations this week, The New Yorker cited what it described as a whistleblower report and other documents about his time leading CVA that alleged multiple incidents of alcohol intoxication at work events, inappropriate behavior around female staffers and financial mismanagement. Hegseth, in the op-ed, acknowledged spending too much money during the 2008 campaign in support of then-candidate John McCain, so that Veterans For Freedom went into debt. But he said he stayed on until all bills were paid. And he said his split from CVA was over a “difference of opinion” about the group’s future. Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, a military veteran and sexual assault survivor, stopped short of an endorsement after her meeting with Hegseth. She said she appreciates his military service and they “had a frank and thorough conversation.” The Trump transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment on Hegseth’s status. In an interview taped Wednesday for Megyn Kelly’s SiriusXM satellite radio show, Hegseth said Trump told him he wanted a “warfighter” who would clean out the “woke crap.” Citing his Capitol Hill meeting, Hegseth said, “No one has looked me in the eye and said, ‘I have concerns.’” He added, “We’re not backing down one bit.” Hegseth paid a woman who accused him of sexual assault at a California hotel in 2017 after Hegseth had given a speech at a Republican event. His lawyer said the payment was to head off the threat of a baseless lawsuit. Asked by Kelly if he sexually assaulted the woman, Hegseth said “absolutely not.” He called it a “really unfortunate situation” and said he paid her because he “had to,” contending that her lawyers said they would “out him.” He declined to reveal the amount paid, but said it was done to protect his wife, himself and his job. He said it is a “fair characterization” to call him a serial cheater, who cheated on all three of his wives. “Was I a perfect man, absolutely not,” he said. Hegseth flatly denied having a drinking problem and said he wouldn’t drink while defense secretary, vowing, “I’m not going to have a drink at all.” He likened it to following the Pentagon’s general order No. 1, which prohibits troops from drinking while deployed. GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who joined Hegseth in a meeting with House Republicans, defended the nominee and said: “All of us, at least all of us, have a time to grow up. We’re nominating Pete for who he is today, not for what he did seven years ago or five years ago or whatever it was.” Cramer said Hegseth during their meeting acknowledged there were times that he drank too much, but that nothing improper happened. He said Hegseth also denied aspects of the New Yorker report, including that he was drunk at a strip club with coworkers and tried to get up on the stage and dance. Cramer said Hegseth told him “I’ve never been at a strip club in Louisiana intoxicated” and that he has “certainly never been on a stage, you know, in an intoxicated state.” “I have no reason to doubt him any more than believe somebody else,” Cramer said. Earlier, Hegseth’s mother appeared on Fox News to address some of the allegations. Penelope Hegseth, on “Fox & Friends,” discussed her son and a 2018 email she wrote him that was obtained by The New York Times, in which she confronted him about mistreating women after he impregnated his current wife while he was married to his second wife. That letter followed multiple allegations, reported by The New Yorker this week, of questionable conduct around female staffers, in addition to the 2017 allegation. On Tuesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said some of the reports were “disturbing,” telling CBS News that he wants to “make sure that every young woman that joins the military feels respected and welcomed.” Penelope Hegseth implored the lawmakers to listen to her son and give him a chance. “I think it can be overcome,” Penelope Hegseth said. Hegseth is a former Fox News host and a former Army National Guard major and combat veteran who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. If confirmed by the Senate, he would lead a 2-million-member strong military — more than 17% of whom are female. The revelations have concerned some members of Congress. Hegseth said in his interview that he doesn’t know how all this will turn out but is comfortable that he “took on the haters and the liars” and fought for it, adding, “the future’s in God’s hands.” Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Michelle L.

272,French lawmakers to hold no-confidence vote against embattled Barnier government on Wednesday,"French lawmakers will debate and vote on the no-confidence motions filed against the fragile government of Michel Barnier on Wednesday. The motions, which have been tabled by the opposition left-wing bloc and by the far-right National Rally party, will be debated at around 4 p.m., the National Assembly said in a social media post. The government must step down if the either measure is approved by parliament. It comes after French Prime Minister Barnier on Monday opted to push through a highly-contested budget bill without parliamentary approval by deploying special constitutional powers. The left and right are widely expected to be able to form an alliance to oust the current center-right government. “Barnier is at the mercy of Marine Le Pen’s right-wing Rassemblement National [National Rally]. Jointly with the united Left, she could topple Barnier in a no-confidence vote,” Berenberg’s Chief Economist Holger Schmieding warned in a note last week. Attempts at compromise over the budget bill — which outlines 60 billion euros ($63.16 billion) in tax hikes and spending cuts to reduce France’s deficit — stalled over the weekend. It is unclear what will happen next, if the government is toppled. New parliamentary elections cannot be held until next June, 12 months after the last snap vote that was called by French President Emmanuel Macron this year. Macron will also need to appoint a new prime minister — a politically charged task, given the fractured nature of the current parliament. France’s CAC 40 index was 0.57% higher after the Wednesday vote was confirmed, while the euro traded up 0.3% against the U.S. dollar. French bond yields were little changed. Economists nonetheless say looming political instability could bring bad news for French assets, with the uncertainty already driving French borrowing costs to a 12-year high over those of Germany, and sitting at a level with those of Greece. - CNBC’s Holly Ellyatt contributed to this story.",CNBC,Center,316,"Lean Left  
The article primarily focuses on the actions of the left-wing opposition and the challenges faced by the center-right government of Michel Barnier, highlighting their efforts to hold a no-confidence vote. The framing is critical of Barnier’s government while showing a degree of support for the left, indicating a bias towards left-leaning perspectives. The emphasis on political instability and the collaboration between the far-right and left further suggests a critique of the current government rather than an objective analysis, leaning the bias leftwards."

Wilkinson Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters. Protesters took to the US Capitol bathrooms across from House Speaker Mike Johnson’s office on Thursday to protest the recently enacted policy banning trans people from accessing bathrooms that align with their gender identity. Just a day after the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case that may upend gender-affirming care for children and adults across the United States, dozens of trans people and their allies raised banners demanding Congress “stop pissing on our rights” and urging supporters to “flush bathroom bigotry.” “It was important to show up in a radically defiant way and let the world know, and let our electeds know, that we are not going to allow this disrespect and this disregard for our lives,” Raquel Willis, co-founder of Gender Liberation Movement and one of the organizers of the demonstration, told Mother Jones. “Trans folks deserve access to the restrooms like anyone else.” Organizers said about 15 people were arrested for crowding and obstructing, including Willis and Chelsea Manning, the whistleblower who leaked troves of classified government records about Iraq and Afghanistan to WikiLeaks. According to The 19th, Capitol police threatened protesters with sexual misconduct charges, although a Gender Liberation Movement spokesperson said no such charges were filed. Intelligence whistleblower Chelsea Manning is escorted from the Capitol in handcuffs after protesting the policy prohibiting trans people from using the bathrooms that align with their gender identity.Courtesy Alexa B. Wilkinson The demonstration, which Willis said was inspired by civil rights sit-ins of the past, was in response to the efforts spearheaded by Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican who, weeks after the election, vowed to propose a trans bathroom ban to target the first openly trans person elected to Congress, Democrat Sarah McBride from Delaware. After Speaker Johnson announced that bathroom access would be restricted—which he did on the Trans Day of Remembrance—Mace went still further, announcing that the ban she proposed would be extended to include all federal property, including museums and national parks. “Oh you thought threatening me would silence me?” Mace wrote in a post on X. “No. I just doubled down and filed a new bill to protect women and girls across the entire country on all federal property everywhere.” MOTHER JONES TOP STORIES 1/100:27motherjones RSS feed S After the protest, Mace called protesters an anti-trans slur in an X post. “These attacks aren’t just about trans people. These are attacks that will be continued, that will be utilized against other communities on the margins.” “Every person deserves dignity and respect, both in daily life and in more symbolic places like the US Capitol,” Manning, whose sentencing for leaking classified information was commuted by then-President Barack Obama after a seven-year imprisonment, said in a statement. “As someone who has fought against similar rules, I know what it’s like to feel pushed aside and erased. But I also know the incredible power and resilience our community has.” Trans bathroom ban proposals have proliferated across the United States, with 14 states enacting restrictions since 2021, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Most recently, Ohio enacted a bathroom ban encompassing all K–12 schools and colleges, affecting trans students’ access not only to school restrooms but also to university dormitories. Proponents of the bans, including Mace, argue that they’re necessary to protect the safety of women and girls from would-be assaulters. Researchers, however, have found no link between trans-inclusive bathroom policies and safety risks. In fact, research shows that trans people face greater risk of sexual harassment and assault when restrictive bathroom policies are in place. Even without such bans, trans people already face a disproportionate risk of violence, particularly sexual violence. Willis said that as attacks on trans rights escalate, it is critical that allies—including Democratic elected officials—push against anti-trans policies and rhetoric. She described Democrats as “missing in action” while a coordinated wave of anti-trans legislation has spread across states since 2021. “These attacks aren’t just about trans people,” she said. “These are attacks that will be continued, that will be utilized against other communities on the margins.”",MotherJones,Left,708,"Left

170,Breaking Down Donald Trump’s Call for ‘Energy Dominance’ and Its Potential Real-World Limits,"WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump is set to create a National Energy Council that he says will establish American “energy dominance” around the world as he seeks to boost U.S. oil and gas drilling and move away from President Joe Biden’s focus on climate change. The energy council — to be led by North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump’s choice to head the Interior Department — will be key in Trump’s pledge to “drill, drill, drill"" and sell more oil and other energy sources to allies in Europe and around the globe. The new council will be granted sweeping authority over federal agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, with a mandate to cut bureaucratic red tape, enhance private sector investments and focus on innovation instead of “totally unnecessary regulation,” Trump said. But Trump's energy wishes are likely to run into real-world limits. For one, U.S. oil production under Biden is already at record levels. The federal government cannot force companies to drill for more oil, and production increases could lower prices and reduce profits. A call for energy dominance — a term Trump also used in his first term as president — ""is an opportunity, not a requirement,'' for the oil industry to move forward on drilling projects under terms that are likely to be more favorable to industry than those offered by Biden, said energy analyst Kevin Book. Whether Trump achieves energy dominance — however he defines it — ""comes down to decisions by private companies, based on how they see supply-demand balances in the global marketplace,'' said Book, managing partner at ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington research firm. Don't expect an immediate influx of new oil rigs dotting the national landscape, he said. Trump's bid to boost oil supplies — and lower U.S. prices — is complicated by his threat this week to impose 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico, two of the largest sources of U.S. oil imports. The U.S. oil industry warned the tariffs could raise prices and even harm national security. “Canada and Mexico are our top energy trading partners, and maintaining the free flow of energy products across our borders is critical for North American energy security and U.S. consumers,” said Scott Lauermann, speaking for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry’s top lobbying group. American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents U.S. refineries, also opposes potential tariffs, saying in a statement that “American refiners depend on crude oil from Canada and Mexico to produce the affordable, reliable fuels consumers count on every day."" Energy lobbyist Scott Segal said the idea of centering energy decisions at the White House follows an example set by Biden, who named a trio of White House advisers to lead on climate policy. Segal, a partner at the law and policy law firm Bracewell, called Burgum “a steady hand on the tiller” with experience in fossil fuels and renewables. And unlike Biden’s climate advisers — Gina McCarthy, John Podesta and Ali Zaidi — Burgum will probably take his White House post as a Senate-confirmed Cabinet member, Segal said. Dustin Meyer, senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs at the American Petroleum Institute, called the new energy council “a good thing” for the U.S. economy and trade. “Conceptually it makes a lot of sense to have as much coordination as possible,” he said. Still, “market dynamics will always be the key'' for any potential increase in energy production, Meyer said. Jonathan Elkind, a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, called energy dominance a “deliberately vague concept,” but said, “It's hard to see how (Trump) can push more oil into an already saturated market."" Trump has promised to bring gasoline prices below $2 a gallon, but experts call that highly unlikely, since crude oil prices would need to drop dramatically to achieve that goal. Gas prices averaged $3.06 nationally as of Friday, down from $3.25 a year ago, according to AAA. Elkind and other experts said they hope the new energy council will move beyond oil to focus on renewable energy such as wind, solar and geothermal power, as well as nuclear. None of those energy resources produces greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. ""Failure to focus on climate change as an existential threat to our planet is a huge concern and translates to a very significant loss of American property and American lives,'' said Elkind, a former assistant energy secretary in the Obama administration. He cited federal statistics showing two dozen weather disasters this year that caused more than $1 billion in damage each. A total of 418 people were killed. Trump has played down risks from climate change and pledged to rescind unspent money in the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s landmark climate and health care bill. He also said he will stop offshore wind development when he returns to the White House in January. Even so, his Nov. 15 announcement of the energy council says he will “expand ALL forms of energy production to grow our Economy and create good-paying jobs.” That includes renewables, said Safak Yucel, associate professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. ""The mandate for the energy council is U.S. dominance globally, but what's more American than American solar and American wind?'' he asked. A report from Ernst & Young last year showed that solar was the cheapest source of new-build electricity in many markets. Trump, in his statement, said he wants to dramatically increase baseload power to lower electricity costs, avoid brownouts and “WIN the battle for AI superiority."" In comments to reporters before he was named to the energy post, Burgum cited a similar goal, noting increased demand for electricity from artificial intelligence, commonly known as AI, and fast-growing data centers. “The AI battle affects everything from defense to health care to education to productivity as a country,″ Burgum said. While Trump mocks the climate law as the “green new scam,” he is unlikely to repeal it, Yucel and other experts said. One reason: Most of its investments and jobs are in Republican congressional districts. GOP members of Congress have urged House Speaker Mike Johnson to retain the law, which passed with only Democratic votes. “A lot of Southern states are telling Trump, ‘We actually like renewables,'"" Yucel said, noting that Republican-led states have added thousands of jobs in recent years in wind, solar and battery power. If renewables make economic economic sense, he added, ""they'll continue.''",TIME,Lean Left,1079,"Lean Left  
This article critiques Donald Trump's energy policies and comments on potential limits, while also highlighting concerns from environmental experts and the oil industry regarding climate change and market saturation. The inclusion of diverse expert opinions, including those critical of Trump's agenda, suggests a left-leaning perspective. The emphasis on climate change risks and the current administration's regulatory approach contrasts with Trump's pro-oil stance, framing him in a negative light relative to the climate issue. The overall tone reflects skepticism towards conservative energy policies."

In what was likely the final time that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, Director Ur Jaddou testified before lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Jaddou argued that the agency was closing up four years under her leadership with great success — a point that infuriated Republicans for how they claimed it had sunk into chaos during her tenure. “Before I arrived, a perfect storm of policy and operational decisions, COVID, and a severely outdated fee structure led to a fiscal crisis,” Jaddou said about the 22,500-person agency before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement. “The results were a hiring freeze, the termination of support contracts, the issuance of furlough notices to 70% of the workforce. And as you might imagine, very low morale.” Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) praised USCIS for having completed 10 million immigration cases that were pending decisions in fiscal year 2023, despite the setbacks. Jaddou touted a decrease in the pending immigration case backlog last year for the first time in a decade and “the security and vetting” of immigrants and sponsors was the “number one” priority for USCIS. Additionally, USCIS was tasked in late 2022 with vetting immigrant sponsors in the United States and providing documents to the more than 530,000 immigrants outside the U.S. who requested admission to fly into the country. Immigrants from four countries under the CHNV Program — Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — were admitted on a temporary, two-year basis. The program was quietly shuttered earlier this year for over a month after the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General found rampant fraud from sponsors. Rep. Tom Tiffany (R-WI) called into question how USCIS had been able to decide more cases than in years past despite its being crippled during the pandemic, particularly given the fraud allegations. “The other side was saying, ‘We’ve completed 10 million cases,'” said Tiffany. “It’s not hard to complete 10 million cases when you’re not reviewing them.” Jaddou maintained that USCIS had done its best to maintain efficiency, integrity, and security. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER The CBP One app permits immigrants from four countries, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, to apply to enter the U.S. on parole, which allows an individual to remain for two years and receive a work permit. Recipients must have a sponsor in the U.S. and pay for their international commercial flights. The app’s function for allowing immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to apply and fly into the country was part of a “carrot and stick deal with Mexico,” and in return, Mexico allowed the U.S. the ability to remove some citizens of those countries at the border back to Mexico.",WashingtonExaminer,Lean Right,719,"Lean Right  
The article primarily presents criticisms from House Republicans regarding the Biden administration's immigration policies, focusing on accusations of ineffective vetting and management.

203,Amazon sued over slower deliveries to low-income neighborhoods,"Amazon secretly excluded two ZIP codes from its fastest delivery service while charging nearly 50,000 Prime members who live in the areas its full Prime subscription price, the District of Columbia's attorney general alleges in a lawsuit filed Wednesday. Amazon violated consumer protection laws by stopping its quickest delivery service to the two historically lower-income neighborhoods, then misled customers about why their packages were arriving later than advertised when they complained, according to the suit filed in D.C. Superior Court. The world's biggest online retailer's paid subscription service, Amazon Prime, offers two-day delivery for millions of items, as well as next-day or same-day for many other products for $139 a year, or $14.99 a month. Amazon in June 2022 decided to stop using its fleet of branded trucks to make Prime deliveries to D.C. ZIP codes 20019 and 20020, servicing them instead with third-party delivery services like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service. The company knew the decision would result in significantly slower deliveries for the areas, but did not tell existing or prospective customers, the suit alleges. Amazon informed the attorney general's office that the change came as the result of safety concerns for its drivers, the attorney general said. Yet the company was legally obligated to disclose the change to customers. ""Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide. While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one ZIP code is worth less than a dollar in another,"" D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb stated in a news release.""We're suing to stop this deceptive conduct and make sure District residents get what they're paying for."" Last year, the rest of the city's Prime members received packages within two days of checkout 75% of the time, but those in the impacted ZIP codes received their orders within two days just 24% of the time, according to the suit. Amazon dismissed as ""categorically false"" claims that its business practices are discriminatory or deceptive. ""We want to be able to deliver as fast as we possibly can to every ZIP code across the country, however, at the same time we must put the safety of delivery drivers first,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The spokesperson added, ""In the ZIP codes in question, there have been specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages. We made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers."" The company said it's clear with customers about expected delivery dates. ""And we're always transparent with customers during the shopping journey and checkout process about when, exactly, they can expect their orders to arrive,"" the spokesperson said. Amazon would like to work with the attorney general's office to reduce crime and improve safety in those areas, the spokesperson stated. ""Nevertheless, we will proceed in the process and demonstrate that providing fast and accurate delivery times and prioritizing the same of customers and delivery partners are not mutually exclusive."" The lawsuit is not the first time Amazon has been accused of providing discriminatory service. A Bloomberg analysis in 2016 found that Amazon excluded predominantly black ZIP codes to varying degrees from same-day delivery in six major cites. Amazon at the time said the issue had nothing to do with race. And two years later, the since-discontinued Amazon Restaurants delivery service excluded the same D.C. neighborhoods that are the focus of the Prime delivery lawsuit. The company told local news at the time that it was working to bring more eateries online.",CBS,Lean Left,614,"Lean Left  
This article presents a critical view of Amazon's business practices, focusing on alleged discrimination against low-income neighborhoods, which often aligns with a left-leaning perspective that advocates for social justice and consumer rights. The use of strong language from the D.C. Attorney General, along with the focus on the impact on marginalized communities, reflects a bias towards highlighting corporate accountability and socio-economic issues. The article does present Amazon's defense, but the framing of the complaint and emphasis on consumer protection suggests a leaning towards leftist viewpoints."
266,California special session to ‘safeguard’ state from Trump kicks off with proposed $25 million legal fund,"Gov. Gavin Newsom’s special legislative session to safeguard California from potential “federal overreach” by the incoming Trump administration began Monday, teeing up a potential battle between the president-elect and the most populous U.S. state. Newsom is working with lawmakers to create a new litigation fund of up to $25 million to support California’s legal resources in anticipation of “policy proposals that would harm the state,” according to a release from the governor’s office Monday. Reproductive rights and environmental causes are two of the focus areas. The fund would be for the California Department of Justice and other state agencies to be used for court challenges and administrative actions. Newsom announced the session following Trump’s election victory last month. Hearings will take place over the next several weeks, with a goal of signing legislation into law before Trump’s inauguration Jan. 20. Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump transition, said in a statement that the president-elect will pursue his agenda despite efforts by Newsom to “Trump-proof California.” “President Trump received the most votes for a Republican presidential candidate in the deep blue state of California since 2004,” Leavitt said. “Californians showed up for President Trump in historic numbers because they cannot afford another four years of Gavin Newsom’s dangerously liberal agenda — high taxes, unaffordable housing costs, and an invasion of illegal immigrants from our wide-open border.” In a conversation with volunteers after the election, Newsom said the state needed to be ready for action as the next administration takes hold. “I think there’s a lot of onus that’s placed upon California because [of] the size, scale and scope of this state,” he said at the time. “We need to assert ourselves, and we need to prepare ourselves firmly and plant, as I say, our feet at peril that we get swept away.” Trump’s first term in the White House set the stage for what could be coming. From 2017 through 2021, the California DOJ sued the Trump administration 122 times, investing $42 million in the process, Newsom’s office said, adding that legal wins resulted in millions of dollars in reimbursements from the federal government and the protection of billions of dollars in federal funding. Last week, the governor committed to restarting the state’s Zero Emission Vehicle rebate if a federal $7,500 tax credit is eliminated. Bloomberg News reported the current proposal includes market share limitations that would exclude Tesla’s EV models, but said Newsom’s office indicated the details would be negotiated with the state legislature and were subject to change. In response to the proposal, Tesla CEO and Trump booster Elon Musk wrote on X, “Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.” Newsom pledged to work with the Trump administration, but warned in a statement that he will be looking after his state’s residents. “California is a tent pole of the country — from the economy to innovation to protecting and investing in rights and freedoms for all people,” he said. “We will work with the incoming administration and we want President Trump to succeed in serving all Americans. But when there is overreach, when lives are threatened, when rights and freedoms are targeted, we will take action. And that is exactly what this special session is about — setting this state up for success, regardless of who is in the White House.” California wasn’t spared a broader move to the right in the election. Conservative district attorneys were voted into office in major counties, including Nathan Hochman in Los Angeles. In Alameda County, District Attorney Pamela Price and Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao faced successful recalls. And in San Francisco, centrist Democrat Daniel Lurie, who has never held public office, won the mayoral race, beating incumbent London Breed. California voters also adopted a proposition that increases penalties for certain drug and theft crimes while rebuffing a measure to raise the state’s minimum wage to $18 an hour. The economy took precedence over social issues across the state, according to polling from the Public Policy Institute of California.

The article discusses California's efforts to counter a Trump administration, portraying the state's actions as a necessary response to potential federal overreach. It highlights themes aligned with progressive values, such as environmental rights and reproductive rights. Governor Newsom's framing of the issue reflects a protective stance toward state interests against conservative policies, which tends to appeal more to left-leaning audiences. However, it also includes perspectives from the Trump camp, showing some balance, which is typical of a ""Lean Left"" classification rather than an outright partisan viewpoint."
148,Actress Annette Bening Pushes Sex Changes for Minors Outside SCOTUS: Having a ‘Transgender Child’ Made Me ‘More Wise’,"Actress Annette Bening rallied outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday as justices heard oral arguments in a case surrounding Tennessee’s law banning sex change drugs and procedures for minors who believe they are transgender. The American Beauty star pressed for confused minors to have access to sex-mutilating drugs and surgeries, and called upon her experience with her own daughter, Stephen Ira Beatty, who identifies as a man. “I have four beautiful children, and I’m allowed to brag about my children ’cause they’re mine. And my eldest is a remarkable trans man, an extraordinary human being,” she said to a crowd of people outside the nation’s highest court. “As a well-meaning parent, I didn’t always know how to support my teenager — my vulnerable teenager who was just trying to live his truth. But you know what? I learned.” “I learned that what these kids and families need is judicious counseling, sound medical advice, and an atmosphere of calm and love and acceptance,” she continued. “Our trans kid and all trans folks need to be seen and heard. There is nothing to be frightened of.” Bening went on to assert that people who identify as transgender “are everywhere” and that it is “our responsibility to support and love them.” “I think the greatest gift of my life is to have kids, and to have a transgender child has made me so much more interesting, so much more wise,” she said with a touch of humor to her voice, as the crowd cheered and laughed. “And for the Supreme Court justices, I encourage them to talk to their kids, their grandkids, their nieces and nephews, because I’ll bet if they really sit down and ask them, do you know trans kids around you? Do you have any non-binary friends? They’re going to say yes. And they’re going to say that this is part of the beautiful rainbow of human beings everywhere,” she concluded. Bening has previously spoken in favor of sex changes for minors, claiming that parents who allow such procedures simply want “what is best” for their child. She also previously said her transgender child is “such an inspiration” to her, and wished everyone would have a trans person in their family in order to truly “get it.” RELATED: Mothers Pushing Transgenderism on Children Seek ‘Mama Bear Crusade’ The Biden administration ultimately asked the Supreme Court to reverse a ruling from the Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upholding Tennessee’s law protecting minors from sex-mutilating drugs and surgeries. “This is a relatively new diagnosis with ever-shifting approaches to care over the last decade or two. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for anyone to be sure about predicting the long-term consequences of abandoning age limits of any sort for these treatments,” Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton, who was joined by Judge Amul Thapar, wrote for the 6th Circuit. As almost half of the United States has passed laws barring minors from obtaining transgender drugs and surgeries, the resulting Supreme Court ruling will likely have wide-ranging impacts for the future of so-called “gender-affirming care,” as well as parental rights. READ MORE: Transgender Curbs Protect Children, Not Sexism, Lawyer Tell SCOTUS The side effects for sex change drugs and procedures can be severe, including irreversible mutilation and infertility. Some of these so-called treatments include double mastectomies (the removal of healthy breasts), female and male genital mutilation and removal, facial feminization and masculinization, hormone treatments, and puberty blockers that can cause chemical sterilization. Puberty blockers can also have long-term impact on bone growth, bone density, and growth spurts, according to Mayo Clinic. Transgender activists frequently claim that such sex-mutilating drugs and procedures for confused minors reduce suicides and improve mental health — dubious claims which increasingly appear untrue as more studies and data come to light. Other research has indicated that a majority of children who are confused about their sex grow out of that feeling by the time they become adults. Opponents of sex changes for minors argue that it is impossible for young people to comprehend and legally consent to the potential lasting impacts of these drugs and surgeries. European countries that pushed sex change drugs and surgeries for minors before the United States are notably reversing course over concerns about long-term impacts. In the United States, the top-down push for minors to obtain sex-mutilating drugs and surgeries under the misleading moniker “gender-affirming care” is clear, promulgated by President Joe Biden’s White House, academia, large hospitals, and major medical organizations. READ MORE: Biden Administration Promotes Transgender Sex-Change Surgery, Puberty Blockers for Minors At the root, these actors, along with the proliferation of gender ideology on social media, ultimately promote the false idea that human beings can be a different sex than what they were born as. Even further, the gender ideology complex claims these individuals should take sex-change drugs and get sex-change procedures to align their outward appearance with how they feel on the inside. While the push toward transgenderism is heavily ideological, a report released in December 2020 found that the U.S. sex reassignment surgery market size was valued at $267 million in 2019 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 14.4 percent from 2020 to 2027.

The article presents a critical perspective on transgender healthcare for minors, highlighting Annette Bening's views and contrasting them with supposed negative consequences of sex change procedures. It cites legal and medical concerns while framing the debate around the supposed dangers of gender-affirming care, suggesting a bias against progressive ideologies surrounding transgender issues.

75,Brian Thompson shooting: what we know about the killing and the suspect so far,"The hunt for the suspect in the killing of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, has entered a second day – and New York police issued a fresh image clearly showing the face of a man they are looking for in connection with the shooting. Thompson, who ran one of the the US’s largest health insurers, was fatally shot on Wednesday in midtown Manhattan. Shell casings found at the scene reportedly had the words “deny”, “defend” and “depose” written on them. Here’s what we know about Thompson, the shooting and the suspect so far: Brian Thompson was shot outside a midtown Manhattan hotel at about 6.45am local time. He had been due to speak at a conference in the city on Wednesday. Surveillance footage showed a person believed to be the shooter making a phone call near the hotel at about 6.30am ET. According to police, the suspect appeared to be waiting for the UnitedHealthcare CEO for several minutes. Officials said he approached Thompson from behind and shot him in the back before moving toward the victim and continuing to shoot. Ultimately, Thompson was shot in the back and at least once in the calf. Authorities said the shooter’s gun appeared to malfunction, and he cleared the jam before firing again and fleeing northbound into an alleyway between 54th Street and 55th Street. The shooter then continued to walk westbound on the Avenue of the Americas, where he got on to an electric bike and rode northbound towards Central Park. Police noted that they were working to gather information about the ebike, specifically its GPS tracker. Video footage of the shooting showed that the suspect was “proficient in firearms” and able to clear a jam in his gun in the midst of the attack, police said. Police were not able to determine from the video that they currently have access to whether a silencer had been used. Police say they recovered three live 9mm rounds and three discharged 9mm shell casings. Officers recovered a cellphone near the scene of the shooting and are conducting forensic analysis to see whether it is connected to the victim or the suspect. On Thursday, NYPD released new images of the suspect. They were taken by security cameras at a hostel on the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan where police think the suspect stayed. In previous images issued the suspect was wearing a mask. But late morning on Thursday, police posted photographs showing a young man smiling and one of the same person looking more serious, with the hood of his coat up. The suspect remained at large while investigators scrambled to find out his identity and as police continued to comb through a vast network of private and public surveillance cameras. Law enforcement deployed drones and dogs in addition to sifting through data related to public-use electric bikes. Among clues discovered were a cell phone, video footage of the suspect and shell casings from bullets found at the scene with the words “deny”, “defend” and “depose”. In short, not that much yet. New York’s police commissioner, Jessica Tisch, called Thompson’s killing a “brazen targeted attack” that “does not appear to be a random act of violence”. “I want to be clear at this time: every indication is that this was a premeditated, pre-planned, targeted attack,” she said. However, the motive for the shooting remains unclear. Police are searching for the gunman and offering up to $10,000 to anyone with information regarding Thompson’s death. Brian Thompson was 50, lived in Minnesota and had been UnitedHealthcare’s CEO since 2021. A father of two, Thompson lived in a suburb of Minneapolis, about a 20-minute drive from the company’s headquarters. He was in New York for the annual UnitedHealthcare investor conference scheduled to take place on Wednesday morning. An alumnus of the University of Iowa, Thompson joined the company in 2004 from accountancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers. He was named chief executive officer for UnitedHealthcare in April 2021 after serving in several other roles, most recently as chief executive officer of UnitedHealthcare’s government programs business. Before this role, he had served as CEO of UnitedHealthcare government programs including Medicare and retirement, and community and state. In a phone call to NBC News, Thompson’s wife, Paulette, said: “There had been some threats. Basically, I don’t know, a lack of coverage? I don’t know details. I just know that he said there were some people that had been threatening him.” While she did not elaborate on “lack of coverage” to the network, the comment comes in the wake of backlash that UnitedHealthcare has experienced about its insurance coverage. Earlier this year, protesters were arrested outside the company’s headquarters in Minnesota, and were reportedly there in an effort to shed light on the organization’s alleged “pattern of improper coverage denials”. This article was amended on 4 December 2024 to correct that Brian Thompson was shot in the back and the calf, not in the chest as an earlier version said.",TheGuardiadn,Left,828,"Center

316,Hegseth slams ‘manufactured media takedown’ of him in WSJ op-ed,"Pete Hegseth, President-elect Trump’s pick to lead the Defense Department, condemned the press for what he described as a “manufactured media takedown” of him. “The press is peddling anonymous story after anonymous story, all meant to smear me and tear me down. It’s a textbook manufactured media takedown,” the military veteran wrote in an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. The former Fox News host has come under fire related to allegations of sexual assault connected to an encounter he says was consensual, and previous comments he’s made about not allowing women to be in combat roles in the military. He’s also faced excessive drinking allegations. The New Yorker reported Sunday that Hegseth was forced to step down by two nonprofit advocacy groups he ran due to mismanagement of funds, sexual impropriety and excessive drinking and NBC News reported Tuesday that Hegseth’s drinking worried colleagues at Fox News, where he was a weekend host until earlier this month. A New York Times story published last week reported that Hegseth’s mother sent him an email in 2018 accusing him of “routinely mistreating women for years” and displaying a “lack of character.” In a phone interview with The Times, his mother, Penelope Hegseth, said that she sent a follow-up message at the time apologizing for her original email, claiming she sent the email “in anger, with emotion” when her son and his wife were going through a divorce. “It is not true. It has never been true,” she told The Times. “I know my son. He is a good father, husband,” she added, also saying the email getting published was “disgusting.” Hegseth has maintained that he won’t back down amid the backlash and reinforced that notion in his op-ed. He faces an uphill battle toward Senate confirmation. Hegseth was set to meet with Sens. Ted Budd (R-N.C.), James E. Risch (R-Idaho) and Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) on Tuesday. Just four Republican senators would be needed to side with all Senate Democrats and sink his nomination. “I have never backed down from a fight and won’t back down from this one. I am grateful President-elect Trump chose me to lead the Defense Department, and I look forward to an honest confirmation hearing with our distinguished senators—not a show trial in the press,” Hegseth wrote.",NewsNaiton,Center,383,"Lean Right  
The article presents an account of Pete Hegseth defending himself against allegations and critiquing the media's portrayal of him, which suggests a perspective that aligns more closely with conservative viewpoints. The framing of Hegseth as a victim of a media attack, coupled with the favorable quoting of his statements, indicates a bias that leans towards the right side of the political spectrum, reflecting alignment with Trump administration supporters and conservative values."
158,Texas man sentenced to death over gruesome cannibal murder of 3 people he called 'sacrifice to God',"He said that he had studied the Bible and made the human sacrifices for religious reasons. A jury sentenced 44-year-old Jason Thornburg to death over the gruesome murder of three people whose bodies were found burning in a dumpster in 2021. Thornburg was convicted in November of capital murder and sentenced on Wednesday for the murders he referred to as a ""human sacrifice to God."" 'He is a psychopath. He is evil. He is the type of evil that we want to believe doesn't exist in our community.' The bodies of David Lueras, Lauren Phillips, and Maricruz Mathis were found ""heavily dismembered"" in the dumpster in Fort Worth. Police quickly identified one of the bodies but took longer on the other two because of the state of the remains. Thornburg confessed to the murders when he spoke to police and offered horrifying details about what he did to the victims. He said that he had studied the Bible and that the sacrifices were made for religious reasons. He said he rented a room at the Mid City Inn in Euless and brought each of the victims to the room on separate occasions. He slit the throats of two of the victims and strangled the third. He admitted to sexually assaulting a victim's corpse and severing the genitalia of another. He also said he ate part of the heart of a victim. Thornburg said he dismembered the bodies in the bathtub of his room and then hid their remains under his bed. After disposing of the bodies in a dumpster and setting them on fire, Thornberg said that he cleaned out the plastic tubs he used in his insidious crime and then returned them back to the store from which they were purchased. He then confessed to two other murders. Thornberg said that he was responsible for the suspicious death of his roommate, 61-year-old Mark Jewell. Firefighters found Jewell's body after his home exploded in May 2021.He also said that he killed Tanya Begay, who was his girlfriend at the time, in Arizona in 2017. Her body has never been found. Thornberg's attorneys argued that he was suffering from psychotic delusions at the time of the murders and said it would be unjust to execute him. ""You have to decide as jurors, do we execute someone who is psychotic at the time they did something? You have to ask yourself, do we execute someone who is delusional? Is that what we're about as a civilized society? Do we execute someone whose mother left them in a position where they were susceptible to all of the evils in our society? Do we do that as a civilized society?"" argued one attorney. A prosecutor argued to the jury that it was far too dangerous to allow him to live. ""He is a psychopath. He is evil. He is the type of evil that we want to believe doesn't exist in our community. We want to believe we are not raising our children in a world where people like Jason Thornburg exist,"" the prosecutor said. ""We want to believe we live in a world where the Bible is not a weapon, where your vulnerabilities don't make you prey to a serial killer. But so long as we live in a world with Jason Thornburg, said evil will exist.""The jury deliberated for only five hours. Thornburg had no reaction to the reading of the sentence. Like Blaze News?

223,Peter Navarro Served Prison Time Related to Jan. 6. Now Trump Is Bringing Him Back as an Adviser,"WASHINGTON — Former White House adviser Peter Navarro, who served prison time related to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, will return to serve in Donald Trump’s second administration, the president-elect announced Wednesday. Navarro, a trade adviser during Trump’s first term, will be a senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, Trump said on Truth Social. The position, Trump wrote, “leverages Peter’s broad range of White House experience, while harnessing his extensive Policy analytic and Media skills.” The appointment was only the first in a flurry of announcements that Trump made on Wednesday as his presidential transition faced controversy over Pete Hegseth, Trump’s choice for Pentagon chief. Hegseth faces allegations of sexual misconduct, excessive drinking and financial mismanagement, and Trump has considered replacing him with another potential nominee. As he works to fill out his team, Trump said he wanted Paul Atkins, a financial industry veteran and an advocate for cryptocurrency, to serve as the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He wrote on Truth Social that Atkins “recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before.” Trump also said he was changing course on his choice for White House counsel. He said his original pick, William McGinley, will work with the Department of Government Efficiency, which will be run by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy with the goal of cutting federal spending. Now David Warrington, who has worked as Trump’s personal lawyer and a lawyer for his campaign, will serve as White House counsel. In addition, Trump announced the selections of Daniel Driscoll, an Army veteran who was a senior adviser to Vice President-elect JD Vance, as Army secretary; Jared Isaacman, a tech billionaire who conducted the first private spacewalk on Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket, as NASA administrator; and Adam Boehler, a lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords team, as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. Navarro was held in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated Jan. 6. Sentenced to four months in prison, he described his conviction as the “partisan weaponization of the judicial system.” Hours after his release in July, Navarro spoke on stage at the Republican National Convention, where he told the crowd that “I went to prison so you won’t have to."" Navarro, 75, has been a longtime critic of trade arrangements with China. After earning an economics doctorate from Harvard University, he worked as an economics and public policy professor at the University of California, Irvine. He ran for mayor of San Diego in 1992 and lost, only to launch other unsuccessful campaign efforts, including a 1996 race for Congress as a Democrat. During Trump’s initial term, Navarro pushed aggressively for tariffs while playing down the risks of triggering a broader trade war. He also focused on counterfeited imports and even helped assemble an infrastructure plan for Trump that never came to fruition. Navarro often used fiery language that upset U.S. allies. In 2018, after a dispute between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Navarro said “there’s a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door.” Canadians were outraged, and Navarro later apologized. Issacman, 41, has reserved two more flights with SpaceX, including as the commander of the first crew that will ride SpaceX’s mega rocket Starship, still in test flights out of Texas. He said he was honored to be nominated. “Having been fortunate to see our amazing planet from space, I am passionate about America leading the most incredible adventure in human history,” he said via X. Trump kept rolling out positions on Wednesday afternoon. He announced Gail Slater as assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division. Trump wrote on Truth Social that “Big Tech has run wild for years, stifling competition in our most innovative sector.” Slater worked for Trump’s National Economic Council during his first term, and she's been an adviser to Vance. Trump also said Michael Faulkender would serve as deputy treasury secretary. A professor at the University of Maryland’s Smith School of Business, Faulkender was the Treasury Department’s assistant secretary for economic policy during Trump’s initial term. He has also been the chief economist at the America First Policy Institute, a think tank formed to further the Trump movement’s policy agenda. Outside the White House, Trump said that he had asked Michael Whatley to remain on as chair of the Republican National Committee. Whatley ran the committeeduring the election along with Lara Trump, the wife of Trump’s son Eric. ___ AP Aerospace Writer Marcia Dunn in Cape Canaveral, Fla., Josh Boak in Washington and Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.",TIME,Lean Left,800,"Lean Right

46,'It’s war': Why Trump is ready to 'fight' for these 2 Cabinet picks,"Since narrowly defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the United States' 2024 election, President-elect Donald Trump has made one controversial pick after another for his incoming administration. Some of Trump's more conventional picks are likely to be confirmed with bipartisan support by the U.S. Senate in 2025, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) for secretary of state and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum for secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior. But Trump's more controversial choices have been drawing vehement criticism from both Democrats and Never Trump conservatives. Among them: Kash Patel for FBI director, former Fox News host Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense, former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for national intelligence director, and anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). READ MORE:Alarm raised over Trump plot to install nominees without Senate approval Hegseth is so embattled that Trump is reportedly considering nominating Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for defense secretary instead. But according to The Bulwark's Marc A. Caputo, Trump is ready to ""fight"" for RFK Jr. and Gabbard. ""The most imperiled confirmation battle involves Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host whose nomination for defense secretary has been weighed down by accusations of sexual assault and drunkenness, both of which he denies,"" Caputo explains in an article published on December 5. ""Another pitched fight ahead involves longtime Trump loyalist Kash Patel, whose nomination to lead the FBI has triggered his own avalanche of controversy over his embrace of conspiracy theories and calls to incarcerate journalists. But the most critical fights for the president-elect, at least in regard to his immediate political legacy, center around Tulsi Gabbard and Robert Kennedy Jr., former Democrats tapped to head the nation's sprawling intelligence and health bureaucracies, respectively."" Trump's allies, Caputo reports, ""view the stakes differently"" with Gabbard and RFK Jr. Veteran GOP operative Roger Stone told The Bulwark, ""The appointments of RFK and Tulsi Gabbard represent a realignment in American politics that you saw in the election. He understands the historical significance of that realignment."" READ MORE: 'Nothing at all historic': Mehdi Hasan debunks false claim that Trump won by a 'landslide' Trump's allies, according to Caputo, expect the president-elect to ""expend more of his political capital on Gabbard and Kennedy than on any of the other nominees.""

I'm not sure if the boss is willing to fight for that because there are people in our own camp who aren't sure it’s worth it. But Kash should get confirmed. And if they try to touch Tulsi and Kennedy, then it's war."" Another Trump adviser, also quoted anonymously, told The Bulwark, ""If Tulsi or Bobby face real trouble, that's when Trump will really start to fight. They represent the challenging of the status quo of the bureaucracy. That's what MAGA is about.”",AlterNet,Left,489,"Lean Right

41,'Gut punch': Trump clashes with PA steelworkers over $14.9b sale,"Pennsylvania showed how much of a swing state it is when — after favoring Joe Biden in the 2020 election — it chose Republican Donald Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris four years later, but only by roughly 1.7 percent. And the state's 2024 U.S. Senate race was another nailbiter, with incumbent Democratic three-term Sen. Bob Casey Jr. narrowly losing to Republican Dave McCormick. Now, President-elect Trump is engaged in a major debate in Pennsylvania, where he is vowing to block the $14.9 billion sale of U.S. Steel to a Japanese company: Nippon Steele. In a Monday, December 2 post on his Truth Social outlet, Trump wrote, ""Through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs, we will make U.S. Steel Strong and Great Again, and it will happen FAST! As President, I will block this deal from happening. Buyer Beware!!!"" READ MORE:Alarm raised over Trump plot to install nominees without Senate approval But according to Newsweek reporter Sophie Clark, many steelworkers in Pennsylvania want the sale to go through. ""In the Pittsburgh area, where U.S. Steel employs about 3500 people, the company's sale to Nippon has proved popular,"" Clark reports in an article published on December 4. ""Following Trump's statement, Jason Zugai, the vice president of the United Steelworkers Local 2227 branch in West Mifflin, southeast of Pittsburgh, said: 'For me, yeah, very frustrated with the news that came out last night. I didn't expect that to come out, so that was like a gut punch.'"" Clark continues, ""Those pushing for the deal point to Nippon's pledge to, per The Guardian, 'invest no less than $2.7 billion into its unionized facilities, introduce our world-class technological innovation, and secure union jobs so that American steelworkers at U.S. Steel can manufacture the most advanced steel products for American customers.'"" Some Pennsylvania steelworkers, however, share Trump's opposition to the sale. READ MORE: 'Nothing at all historic': Mehdi Hasan debunks false claim that Trump won by a 'landslide' Interviewed by WTAE-TV Channel 4 (an ABC affiliate in Pittsburgh), United Steelworkers President David McCall said of Nippon Steel, ""I don't trust them. And more than that, the fact that they're spending billions — or millions and millions of dollars in PR campaigns, as opposed to answering the needs of our members, concerns us a lot."" McCall added, ""I think U.S. Steel in the Pittsburgh area, I think it's an economic engine. Everybody understands that — certainly, good-paying, family-supportive jobs, thousands of them. And so, it's important that we maintain steel, steelmaking here in the Mon Valley.""

The article presents the views of Pennsylvania steelworkers who are frustrated with Trump's opposition to the sale of U.S. Steel, indicating a preference towards the workers' desire for the deal to proceed. The use of the phrase ""gut punch"" to describe Trump's stance suggests a negative framing towards his position, while the insertion of quotes that portray workers favorably aligns with left-leaning perspectives on labor and economic issues. This emphasis on worker sentiment and criticism of Trump's intervention leans the article towards a left-of-center viewpoint."
31,Trump selects a former soldier and Iraq War veteran to serve as Army secretary,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday that he has selected a former soldier and Iraq War veteran to serve as his secretary of the Army. Daniel P. Driscoll, who is from North Carolina, had been serving as a senior advisor to Vice President-elect JD Vance, whom he met when both were attending Yale Law School. He ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for a North Carolina congressional seat in 2020, getting about 8% of the vote in a crowded field of candidates. “Dan will be a fearless and relentless fighter for America’s Soldiers and the America First agenda,” Trump said on his social media platform. If confirmed, Driscoll, 38, would take the helm of a military branch that has been struggling to overcome recruiting shortfalls through a sweeping overhaul of its programs and staffing. The Army is also undertaking a widespread effort to revamp and modernize its weapons systems. Since his graduation from Yale in 2014 and his tour in the Army, Driscoll has worked at several investment banking and consulting firms in North Carolina. According to the Army, Driscoll served as an armor officer from August 2007 to March 2011, deploying to Iraq from October 2009 to July 2010. He completed Army Ranger school, earning a Ranger tab, but it was not immediately clear when that occurred. Completing the course allows a soldier to wear the tab but does not mean that he served as a Ranger in the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, which is part of the Army’s special operations command and requires significantly more training. He left the military service at the rank of first lieutenant. He also graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Driscoll’s military awards include the Army Commendation Medal and the the combat action badge, which are meritoriously earned. His other awards are often given due to completion of service during a military campaign and include National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal with campaign star, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, and the Overseas Service Ribbon.",APNEWS,Left,342,"Center

386,Tsunami warning sparks panic along West Coast after 7.0-magnitude earthquake — before being canceled,"A tsunami warning stretching across swaths of the West Coast has been lifted after sparking panic and prompting evacuations. The official warning — the National Weather Service’s most severe advisory — was issued after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake shook off the coast of Northern California, near the city of Eureka, at 10:44 a.m. local time Thursday. At least 5.3 million people in California were under the warning, which covered over 500 miles of coastline from Oregon to the San Francisco Bay Area. Many were urged to evacuate or move to higher ground on short notice over fears that a dangerous surge of water would strike just after noon local time. The quake struck off the coast of California on Thursday morning.

2,"Bitcoin has surpassed the $100,000 mark as the post-election rally continues. What’s next?","NEW YORK (AP) — Bitcoin topped $100,000 for the first time as a massive rally in the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, largely accelerated by the election of Donald Trump, rolls on. NEW YORK (AP) — Bitcoin topped $100,000 for the first time as a massive rally in the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, largely accelerated by the election of Donald Trump, rolls on. The cryptocurrency officially to rose six figures Wednesday night, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin has soared since Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5. The asset climbed from $69,374 on Election Day, hitting as high as $103,713 Wednesday, according to CoinDesk. And the latest all-time high arrives just two years after bitcoin dropped below $17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Bitcoin fell below $102,000 by midday Thursday, but its price is still up nearly 7% over the last day. Even amid a massive rally that has more than doubled the value of bitcoin this year, some experts continue to warn of investment risks around the asset, which has quite a volatile history. Here’s what you need to know. Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now. But chances are you’ve heard about it more and more over the last few years. In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority — meaning it’s typically not backed by any government or banking institution — and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain. Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like ethereum, XRP, tether and dogecoin have also gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a “digital alternative” to traditional money, but the large majority of daily financial transactions are still conducted using fiat currencies such as the dollar. Also, bitcoin can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions. A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. Trump, who was once a crypto skeptic, has pledged to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies. On Thursday morning, hours after bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 mark, Trump congratulated “BITCOINERS” on his social media platform Truth Social. He also appeared to take credit for the recent rally, writing, “YOU’RE WELCOME!!!” Top crypto players welcomed Trump’s election victory last month, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they’ve long lobbied for — which, generally speaking, aim for an increased sense of legitimacy without too much red tape. Trump made a move in that direction Wednesday when he said he intends to nominate Atkins to chair the SEC. Atkins was an SEC commissioner during the presidency of George W. Bush. In the years since leaving the agency, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation. He joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization, in 2017. Under current chair Gary Gensler, who will step down when Trump takes office, the SEC has cracked down on the crypto industry — penalizing a number of companies for violating securities laws. Gensler has also faced ample criticism from industry players in the process. One crypto-friendly move the SEC did make under Gensler was the approval in January of spot bitcoin ETFs, or exchange trade funds, which allow investors to have a stake in bitcoin without directly buying it. The spot ETFs were the dominant driver of bitcoin’s price before Trump’s win — but, like much of the crypto’s recent momentum, saw record inflows postelection. Bitcoin surpassing the coveted $100,000 mark has left much of the crypto world buzzing. “What we’re seeing isn’t just a rally — it’s a fundamental transformation of bitcoin’s place in the financial system,” Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of crypto asset manager Anchorage Digital, said in a statement — while pointing to the growth of who’s entering the market, particularly with rising institutional adoption. Still, others note that the new heights of bitcoin’s price don’t necessarily mean the asset is going mainstream. The $100,000 level is “merely a psychological factor and ultimately just a number,” Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at British investment company AJ Bell, wrote in a Thursday commentary. That being said, bitcoin could keep climbing to more and more all-time highs — particularly if Trump makes good on his promises for more crypto-friendly regulation once in office. If Trump actually makes a bitcoin reserve, for example, supply changes could also propel the price forward. Still, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is never promised. Worldwide regulatory uncertainties and environmental concerns around bitcoin “mining” — the creation of new bitcoin, which consumes a lot of energy — are among factors that analysts like Coatsworth note could hamper future growth. And, as still a relatively-young asset with a history of volatility, longer-term adoption has yet to be seen through. Today’s excitement around bitcoin may make many who aren’t already in the space want to get in on the action, but experts continue to stress caution around crypto “FOMO,” or the fear of missing out, especially for small-pocketed investors. “A lot of people have got rich from the cryptocurrency soaring in value this year, but this high-risk asset isn’t suitable for everyone,” Coatsworth noted Thursday. “It’s volatile, unpredictable and is driven by speculation, none of which makes for a sleep-at-night investment.” In short, history shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you’ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day. Coatsworth points to recent research from the Bank for International Settlements, a Switzerland-based global organization of central banks, which found that about three-quarters of retail buyers on crypto exchange apps likely lost money on their bitcoin investments between 2015 and 2022. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, during high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. And the late-2022 collapse of FTX significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall, with bitcoin falling below $17,000. Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool — and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs, and again, now the post-election frenzy. But lighter regulation from the coming Trump administration could also mean less guardrails. “I would say, keep it simple. And don’t take on more risk than you can afford to,” Adam Morgan McCarthy, a research analyst at Kaiko, previously told The Associated Press — adding that there isn’t a “magic eight ball” to know for certain what comes next.",APNEWS,Left,1179,"Lean Right  
The article discusses the rise of Bitcoin and associates it with Donald Trump's election victory, portraying him positively as a cryptocurrency advocate. It includes favorable takes on potential regulatory changes under his administration while acknowledging the risks of cryptocurrency investment. This alignment with right-leaning economic perspectives and a focus on free-market sentiments indicate a lean towards conservative viewpoints regarding economic policy, particularly in cryptocurrency regulation."
317,US seeks comment on airline passenger cash compensation proposal,"CHICAGO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Transportation said on Thursday it was seeking public comment on whether airlines should be required to pay passengers cash compensation when flight disruptions are caused by carriers. The USDOT is giving the public 60 days to comment as it launches the rulemaking process but stopped short of issuing a formal proposal. It will be up to President-elect Donald Trump's administration to decide whether to pursue regulations. Trump has vowed to slash regulations broadly. ""It's very reasonable to say you have some compensation for your time and some protections,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in an interview at an aviation event. He said compensation rules for delays ""would change the economic incentive in a way that motivates airlines to do more."" In May 2023, President Joe Biden said his administration would write rules requiring airlines to compensate passengers for disrupted flights and said the USDOT would issue a proposal by the end of 2023. Canada, Brazil, the European Union and the United Kingdom all have airline delay compensation rules but Buttigieg said the USDOT is not ""copypasting"" Europe's rules. The USDOT wants comment on whether airlines should be required to pay $200-$300 for domestic delays of at least three hours, $375-$525 for six-hour delays, and $750-$775 for nine-hour delays. Airlines for America, a trade group representing American Airlines (AAL.O), opens new tab, Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), opens new tab, United Airlines (UAL.O), opens new tab and others, sharply criticized the proposal. Airlines have sparred with USDOT over flight disruptions and sued to block USDOT's fee disclosure rules. ""Mandating additional cash compensation - beyond what airlines already provide - will drive up ticket prices,"" the group said. ""This proposal is simply one in a long string of ill-conceived and rushed rules from an administration intent on reregulating the U.S. airline industry."" Airlines must refund passengers for canceled flights, but are not required to compensate customers for delays. Major carriers have committed to paying for meals, hotel stays and other expenses when they cause significant flight disruptions. Buttigieg noted, however, that the USDOT had required and prodded airlines to do more. ""I'm not terribly surprised that when we require them to treat passengers better they're going to fight back,"" he said. The USDOT is considering whether small airlines should pay less, if compensation should be required when passengers are notified well in advance, and if airlines must cover meals, hotel stays and other costs after carrier disruptions.

67,Tennessee governor repays trip after ethics panel finds a group shouldn’t have covered it,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee has repaid about $1,900 for a trip to a conference after ethics officials found that he shouldn’t have relied on an outside group to cover the travel. The Tennessee Ethics Commission released the opinion Tuesday, ruling that the payment violated a state law banning officials like the governor from accepting gifts directly or indirectly from a lobbyist or a lobbyist’s employer. The Republican governor had requested the commission’s opinion after his July trip to Florida drew scrutiny. As first reported by The Tennessean, Lee traveled to Marco Island, Florida, to be the keynote speaker at a conference by the Alliance Defending Freedom, which covered his trip. The conservative Christian legal advocacy group is a 501(c)3 nonprofit, and it has a partner 501(c)4 organization named ADF Action. ADF Action has a registered lobbyist in Tennessee. After the ethics opinion’s release, Lee spokesperson Elizabeth Lane Johnson said the expenses had been repaid under the new guidance in connection with the travel to the popular resort island off southwest Florida’s Gulf Coast. “We asked the Bureau for clarity around their interpretation of this vague law and appreciate their response,” Johnson said Tuesday. Lee’s office had argued that the Alliance Defending Freedom, which paid for Lee to come to Florida, doesn’t employ a lobbyist in Tennessee; ADF Action does. His office argued that the two groups are separate, independent and have “legal and operational differences.” However, the Ethics Commission determined that the two groups are “closely related and intertwined organizations.” The panel noted that the ADF Action lobbyist is also employed by the Alliance Defending Freedom and that the lobbyist attended the summit at which Lee spoke. Additionally, the groups have a “shared services agreement” in which they agree to share and reimburse services from each other, but they declined to provide the document for the Ethics Commission to review. The links between the two groups led the commission to determine that the travel expenses were a banned indirect gift from an employer of a lobbyist in the state. They lauded Lee for seeking the opinion and requested he reimburse the money. If officials were to deem the group’s payment for the governor’s travel acceptable, it would “provide a gaping hole” in the ethics law on gifts that would let groups that lobby the state to use a related company “ to lavish gifts upon Tennessee officials and rendering the prohibition on indirect gifts meaningless,” the opinion states. It added that in turn would undermine public confidence in government. ADF Action advocates for “public policies supporting religious freedom, freedom of speech, parental rights, and the sanctity of life and marriage,” according to the ethics opinion. Democratic Rep. Caleb Hemmer of Nashville applauded the Ethics Commission for “making it clear that the governor isn’t above the law.” “It’s disappointing that these actions happened at all,” Hemmer said. “I hope this advisory opinion will stop lobbyist groups from offering these illegal and unethical trips to influence the Lee Administration.” Among its priorities in Tennessee, Alliance Defending Freedom supported a bill approved by lawmakers and Lee this year that requires parental consent for a variety of different actions in schools, including nonemergency medical and mental health care. An Alliance Defending Freedom spokesperson declined to comment on the ethics decision and pointed the AP to the comment from the governor’s office.",APNEWS,Left,561,"Lean Right

127,Suspended NFL Player Responds To Reports About ‘Free Palestine’ Cleats,"Suspended Houston Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair responded aggressively to reports about his wearing cleats with various pieces of Hamas propaganda on them when he did an illegal hit against Jacksonville Jaguars star QB Trevor Lawrence.“IF YOU WANT ME TO BE YOUR VILLAIN, I’LL BE YOUR VILLAIN! SEE YOU SOON…” the Texans player’s X post on Wednesday read.The post included four pictures, one of which included him wearing the shoes with the message proclaiming “Free Palestine” with the word “FREE” written on one side of the cleats in the colors of the Palestinian flag. The other cleat contained a quote from the Quran and a message claiming, “at least 41,788 Palestinians killed” — a statistic taken directly from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry, the Washington Free Beacon reported.Another picture showed a screenshot of the Joker from the 2019 “Joker” movie, and in the final photo, a message that read, “There is a beauty being rejected, misunderstood, unseen, and unprotected by people. It teaches you to rely on Allah for everything.”The cleats are part of the league’s “My Cause My Cleats” campaign, in which players can raise money for various causes. In Al-Shaair’s case, the money raised would go to the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, according to the Houston Texans website. He began wearing the cleats last year following the horrific Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 that left 1,200 Israelis dead, thousands more wounded, and hundreds kidnapped and held hostage.AdvertisementThe relief fund’s partnerships with Hamas-linked groups has also brought increased scrutiny, according to NGO Monitor.The post also followed the decision by the league to uphold the three-game suspension it leveled against Al-Shaair after he was ejected from the game on Sunday following the hit on the quarterback that left Lawrence with a concussion, CBS reported.The NFL’s vice president of policy and rules administration, Jon Runyan, previously said the league had deemed the hit “unacceptable” and that the Texans player’s “continued disregard” for rules governing player safety “will not be tolerated,” ESPN reported.Advertisement“You were involved in a play that the [NFL] considers unacceptable and a serious violation of the playing rules,” Runyan wrote. “Video shows you striking the head/neck area of Jaguars’ quarterback Trevor Lawrence after he clearly goes down in a feet-first slide. … You led with your forearm and helmet and delivered a forceful blow to the head/neck area of your opponent when you had time and space to avoid such contact.”The Texans player later apologized to Lawrence, but also accused critics of racism and Islamophobia.Related: Suspended Texans Linebacker Wears Cleats Featuring Hamas PropagandaAdvertisement",DailyWire,Right,425,"Lean Left  
The article highlights the player's perspective in a way that sympathizes with his cause while illustrating controversy surrounding the cleats, which contain Hamas-linked messaging.

128,U.K. Supreme Court Hearing Arguments Over Definition Of The Word ‘Woman’,"The United Kingdom’s Supreme Court has heard arguments in a case in which the justices must define “what is a woman” as it pertains to the “Equality Act” by the Scottish government.Five Supreme Court justices — three men and two women — agreed to hear the case brought by the women’s rights group For Women Scotland (FWS) against the Scottish legislature after it passed a law stating that every Scottish public board should include an equal amount of men and woman. However, the Scottish government’s definition of “woman” includes trans-identifying men with a “gender recognition certificate” (GRC), the Associated Press reported. It also claimed that the certificate entitled transgender individuals to the same protection under the Equality Act as those born female, the NewStatesmen reported.Lawyer for FWS, Aidan O’Neill, told the justices that “sex” should refer to biological sex as understood “in ordinary, everyday language” when it comes to the Equality Act. A 2022 decision by Scotland’s Court of Session ruled that for the purpose of equality, sex was “not limited to biological or birth sex” and that it included those with a GRC.“Our position is your sex, whether you are a man or a woman or a girl or a boy is determined from conception in utero, even before one’s birth, by one’s body,” O’Neill said. “It is an expression of one’s bodily reality. It is an immutable biological state.”AdvertisementCHECK OUT THE DAILY WIRE HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDEFor Women Scotland’s director, Trina Budge, pointed out, “Not tying the definition of sex to its ordinary meaning means that public boards could conceivably comprise of 50% men, and 50% men with certificates, yet still lawfully meet the targets for female representation.”‘Gender identity, Aidan O’Neill told the court, “is not a trump card against the rights of women”.

23,North Dakota governor charts his path to Interior with a rosy state oil and gas outlook,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has given his choice for Interior secretary a mandate to “Drill baby drill,” and on Wednesday his pick, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, offered a rosy budget picture to lawmakers based largely on his state’s success in extracting near-record levels of oil and gas from the ground. Burgum, whose term ends next week, noted North Dakota’s status as the nation’s No. 3 oil-producing state in his final proposed budget before he begins his role in Trump’s administration, pending Senate confirmation. Besides serving as Interior secretary, Trump has chosen Burgum to lead a newly created National Energy Council that intends to ensure U.S. “energy dominance.” “We look forward to the next four years where we believe that there’s going to be a shift towards innovation over regulation and an opportunity for North Dakota and our mineral owners to be able to more quickly and easily get permitting to access those natural resources for our country,” Burgum told a packed House chamber, also lamenting dozens of energy-related federal regulations his state is fighting. Burgum, a two-term governor and wealthy software entrepreneur, would seem a good choice to carry out Trump’s mandate for both the new council and Interior, where he would oversee public lands and natural resources. Environmentalists are worried about what Trump’s second term will mean for climate-change initiatives. Trump has said he will roll back President Joe Biden’s policies. Oil and gas are key to the economy of North Dakota, where hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling began an oil boom in the late 2000s. State officials pegged a preliminary all-time high of 19,200 producing oil and gas wells in September. Oil taxes have come in 13% over forecast in the state’s 2023-25 budget cycle, or $475 million more than projected, according to a November report. Oil production hit nearly 1.2 million barrels per day in September. North Dakota set its record annual oil production in 2019 — under Burgum — at 524 million barrels, according to a historical report. Last year was the state’s No. 4 year for oil production. Burgum’s $19.5 billion two-year budget recommendation projects oil production of 1.1 million barrels per day in the 2025-27 budget cycle, with oil prices of $62 and $60 per barrels in each year of the next two budget years, respectively. Oil tax revenue is a huge driver of the state budget, which relies on oil taxes for everything from school funding to help with property tax relief, health and human services, and infrastructure projects around the state, said longtime Republican Rep. Mike Nathe, a House budget writer. “Oil revenue touches every community in the state,” Nathe said. Oil taxes also feed the state’s sovereign wealth fund, which has grown to over $11 billion since voters created it in 2010. Hundreds of millions of dollars in earnings come off that fund for lawmakers to put to use. But oil’s volatility hit the state hard in 2016, resulting in a massive revenue shortfall that led to budget cuts and a drain on reserves. Oil forecasts are key to the Legislature’s budget process. Other states revenues are in healthy shape. Total general fund revenues are 12% over forecast, or $392 million, according to a report last month. Sales taxes are 12% ahead, or $182 million. Burgum’s budget includes a $6.5 billion general fund, the state government’s main operating account. The 2023 Legislature approved a record $19.6 billion 2023-25 budget, with a $6 billion general fund and billions in federal money. That total budget was over $1 billion more than what Burgum had recommended. His final template for lawmakers includes increases for state employee salaries and benefits and K-12 education. He outlined focus areas of workforce, housing, infrastructure, information technology and other big items. His recommendations include millions for child care initiatives, addiction help, and housing programs and grants. The Legislature’s budget writers will consider Burgum’s budget in their work, but they will also be getting a budget proposal in mid-January from Burgum’s successor, Republican Gov.-elect-Kelly Armstrong, who takes office Dec. 15. The Legislature convenes in early January. Republicans hold supermajority control of the House and Senate.",APNEWS,Left,689,"Center  
The article presents a straightforward account of North Dakota's budget and oil production, focusing on Republican Gov. Doug Burgum’s proposals without overtly expressing strong political opinions or biases.

399,Alito Calls Out Solicitor General for Ignoring Research That Exposed Risks of Trans Procedures for Kids,"Supreme Court justice Samuel Alito tore into solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar for arguing Wednesday that transgender procedures often result in better outcomes, a claim that fails to take into consideration a growing collection of evidence to the contrary. The justices heard oral arguments Wednesday in United States v. Skrmetti, a case about whether Tennessee’s law banning transgender operations and hormone treatments for minors is Constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Alito quoted Prelogar’s petition to the Court claiming “overwhelming evidence” supports the notion that puberty blockers and hormone treatments improve the well-being of unwell adolescents confused about their gender. The solicitor general’s statement parrots common left-wing activist talking points in favor of giving minors life-altering hormonal and surgical treatments to address mental health struggles during puberty. To counter Prelogar, Alito cited extensive research from European countries showing otherwise, including a study from a Swedish medical board that concluded the risks of transgender treatments likely outweigh purported benefits. Alito also referred to the United Kingdom’s Cass Review, which found little evidence to further the viewpoint that the benefits of transgender treatment are greater than the risks. “I wonder if you would like to stand by the statement in your position or if you think it would now be appropriate to modify that and withdraw your statement,” Alito said. 🔥🔥🔥Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito presses Elizabeth Prelogar on the experimental nature of “gender-affirming care.” He’s exposing the massive scandal of gender experiments on children.https://t.co/btX8lAG0LM pic.twitter.com/kQJsBT06Ud — Tyler O’Neil (@Tyler2ONeil) December 4, 2024 The World Health Organization has similarly acknowledged that the evidence to support transgender procedures is sorely lacking. Research from Finland published earlier this year also found that suicides among kids with gender dysphoria is extremely rare, dispelling the common activist narrative that gender transitions are needed to save the lives of children. Prelogar and transgender-identifying American Civil Liberties Union attorney Chase Strangio argued for striking down Tennessee’s law, while the state’s solicitor general Matt Rice defended the legislation as legitimate and necessary to protect minors from life-altering, experimental procedures. Strangio is a female who identifies as a male and a prominent progressive activist. Confronted with the Cass Report’s finding that trans procedures like those at issue in the case don’t reduce suicidality among the adolescents who receive them, Strangio conceded the point, acknowledging that very few gender-dysphoric children actually go through with suicide, but argued that there is evidence that the procedures reduce suicidal inclinations. The Biden administration and the ACLU are siding with multiple transgender plaintiffs challenging Tennessee’s law protecting minors from irreversible transgender medical interventions. Numerous red states have enacted similar bans in response to the growing number of patients who have come to regret the medical procedures and the increased participation of biological males in women’s sports. Several detransitioners have raised their voices to describe how they were rushed into permanently scarring transgender operations when they were mentally distressed teenagers. Some detransitioners have filed lawsuits alleging medical practitioners wrongfully pushed them to undergo treatments with lasting consequences such as infertility and sexual dysfunction. Missouri gender-clinic whistleblower Jamie Reed came forward with allegations last year that her facility in St. Louis was pushing severely disturbed minors into life-altering treatment with little interest in alternative options. The New York Times later substantiated Reed’s allegations, which played a major part in red-state legislation to prevent minors from receiving transgender medical operations. The leading medical organization pushing for the transgender treatments is the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), a group that internally observed the experimental nature of transgender operations and patients’s lack of awareness of their consequences. The oral arguments in the Skrmetti case are taking place in the backdrop of President-elect Trump’s resounding election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, in part because he contrasted Harris’s position on transgender-related issues to his own. One of the most effective political advertisements of the presidential cycle was Trump’s TV spot highlighting Harris’s past promotion of taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries for illegal immigrants. Trump has expressed support for banning transgender hormonal and surgical interventions on distressed minors and Trump has pushed for legislation to reaffirm the fact that there are only two genders. Start your mornings with expert political insights from NR’s Jim Geraghty. Polling taken before the presidential election found that a significant majority of registered voters favored a national ban on transgender procedures such as puberty blockers and surgeries for minors.

336,Federal Judge Rejects ‘Sweetheart’ Boeing Plea Deal over DEI Provision,"A federal judge rejected aerospace company Boeing’s guilty plea deal in connection to multiple fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes in part because of the deal’s diversity, equity, and inclusion provision that would have subjected an independent monitor of Boeing’s operations to DEI requirements. Boeing entered a plea deal with the government in July following a Department of Justice investigation into two fatal wrecks that claimed the lives of 346 individuals. Negotiated in the terms of the deal was an up to $487 million fine and an agreement that would require a DOJ-selected independent monitor to oversee Boeing’s safety procedures for at least three years. The DOJ said in the deal that it would honor its “commitment to diversity and inclusion” when selecting a monitor, a provision about which U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor asked to be briefed by the agency and Boeing in October. In his Wednesday ruling, Judge O’Connor cited concerns with a 2021 Biden administration order that would seemingly “encourage consideration of race in hiring” at federal agencies. “In a case of this magnitude, it is in the utmost interest of justice that the public is confident this monitor selection is done based solely on competency,” O’Connor wrote. The agreement is “not in the public interest,” the judge added, echoing criticisms made by relatives of the victims killed in the two plane crashes. “Judge O’Connor’s emphatic rejection of the plea deal is an important victory,” Paul Cassell, a lawyer for some of the victims’ families, said in response to the ruling. “Judge O’Connor has recognized that this was a cozy deal between [the DOJ and Boeing] that failed to focus on the overriding concerns: holding Boeing accountable for its deadly crime and ensuring that nothing like this happens again in the future.” Aviation giant Boeing “knowingly and willfully” conspired to defraud the U.S. by concealing pertinent information about the 737 MAX’s software systems, according to DOJ prosecutors. The two fatal crashes, a 2018 Lion Air flight and a 2019 Ethiopian Airlines flight, “exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world’s leading commercial airplane manufacturers,” then-acting assistant attorney general David P. Burns of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division said in 2021. “This sweetheart deal fails to recognize that, because of Boeing’s conspiracy, 346 people died. Through crafty lawyering between Boeing and DOJ, the deadly consequences of Boeing’s crime are being hidden,” Cassell said in July.

397,"Judge on Hunter Biden Tax Case Slams President over Pardon, Says Selective-Prosecution Claim ‘Rewrites History’","The federal judge who presided over Hunter Biden’s criminal tax case scolded Joe Biden for claiming his son was the victim of selective prosecution when announcing his pardon for Hunter’s tax and gun crimes. Judge Mark Scarsi issued an order Tuesday night acknowledging Hunter Biden’s pardon and strongly rebuked Biden’s assertion that his son was the victim of selective prosecution. “The President’s statement illustrates the reasons for the Court’s disapproval, as representations contained therein stand in tension with the case record. For example, the President asserts that Mr. Biden ‘was treated differently’ from others ‘who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions,’ implying that Mr. Biden was among those individuals who untimely paid taxes due to addiction,” Scarsi said. The judge pointed out that Hunter Biden said in court filings he was addicted to drugs and alcohol through May 2019, and in his guilty plea on tax-evasion charges admitted to dodging tax payments after becoming sober. Hunter Biden pleaded guilty in September to nine federal tax charges for being unable to pay over $1.4 million of taxes in a timely manner last decade, despite making over $7 million and receiving considerable financial support from entertainment lawyer Kevin Morris. The younger Biden also faced charges for filing false tax forms and failing to file tax forms, in part because he fraudulently deducted personal expenses as business expenses. “And Mr. Biden admitted that he ‘had sufficient funds available to him to pay some or all of his outstanding taxes when they were due,’ but that he did not make payments toward his tax liabilities even ‘well after he had regained his sobriety,’ instead electing to ‘spen[d] large sums to maintain his lifestyle’ in 2020,” Scarsi observed. Hunter Biden’s lavish lifestyle was characterized by an addiction to crack cocaine, affairs with multiple women, and non-stop partying in the Los Angeles area and elsewhere. He largely financed that lifestyle through overseas business dealings involving entities from Ukraine, China, Romania, and other countries during and after his father’s vice presidency. Hunter Biden and his business associates received $27 million from foreign sources over a five-year period last decade, House Republicans determined during the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden. In a statement Sunday night, Joe Biden argued that his son was the subject of selective prosecution by the Justice Department because of political pressure. Scarsi and Delaware federal judge Maryellen Noreika, who oversaw Hunter Biden’s gun conviction in June, both dismissed those arguments in pretrial motions. “But two federal judges expressly rejected Mr. Biden’s arguments that the Government prosecuted Mr. Biden because of his familial relation to the President,” Scarsi noted. “And the President’s own Attorney General and Department of Justice personnel oversaw the investigation leading to the charges. In the President’s estimation, this legion of federal civil servants, the undersigned included, are unreasonable people,” he continued. “The Constitution provides the President with broad authority to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States,” he added, “but nowhere does the Constitution give the President the authority to rewrite history.” Scarsi also took time to admonish Hunter Biden for transmitting the pardon improperly by transmitting a White House press release instead of having an executive agency formally send it over. Once Scarsi receives the official pardon, he will terminate Biden’s upcoming sentencing hearing for the tax charges and dismiss the case in accordance with the pardon. Joe Biden pardoned his son for all crimes he “may have committed” from January 1, 2014 to December 1, 2024, an 11 year period that covers the tax and gun offenses Biden was going to be sentenced for later this month. The time period coincides with the beginning of Hunter Biden’s business dealings with Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, which added him to its board in spring 2014 as his father ran the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy agenda. Many Republicans and some Democrats have criticized Joe Biden for pardoning his son after insisting for months that he would not do so and respect the outcome of his son’s legal proceedings. Joe Biden and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre have claimed that he came to the decision over the weekend to grant the pardon. Donald Trump’s legal team is already using Biden’s criticism of his own Justice Department to their advantage in the president elect’s hush-money case, arguing that the case should be tossed given that it was prosecuted by a Justice Department that, by the president’s own admission, is unreliable. Biden’s claim that Hunter was “selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted” and “treated differently” amount to an “extraordinary condemnation of President Biden’s own DOJ,” Trump’s lawyers wrote. “As President Biden put it yesterday, ‘Enough is enough.’ This case, which should never have been brought, must now be dismissed.” Send a tip to the news team at NR.",NationalReview,Lean Right,799,"Lean Left

323,The Catch-22 of Big Tech Antitrust,"The push to break up Big Tech companies has become a popular refrain among politicians and pundits on both sides of the Atlantic, and, here in the U.S., both sides of the aisle. In response to a federal judge’s ruling in August that Google had an illegal monopoly over search traffic, the Justice Department has proposed that the company sell off Chrome, the world’s most-used web browser, as a remedy. While drastic, this may seem like a clean solution to Google’s dominance in search: Yank apart the distribution network. Yet few antitrust cases have ended in breakups in recent decades, with the last major example being AT&T more than 40 years ago. This rarity stems from a fundamental Catch-22 in tech antitrust: The very factors that make these companies targets are also what make them valuable to consumers. The strongest case for corporate breakups centers on scale and network effects. Scale means companies can drive down costs and increase efficiency as they get bigger. Network effects occur when products become more valuable as more people use them—think of how social media platforms are more useful when your friends are on them. In both cases, size can create powerful feedback loops that entrench a company’s position, leading some to argue that only structural separation can restore competition. The 1984 breakup of AT&T, for example, introduced competition by separating local and long-distance telephone services. However, scale and network effects are what enable businesses to provide significant benefits to consumers. Scale is not a harm. We want companies to grow. Large organizations can leverage their size to create better products, invest more in innovation, and offer services at lower costs. Breaking sections of a company apart risks losing these consumer benefits. This is why achieving scale or large network effects do not, in themselves, violate antitrust law. The shift away from breakups reflects both evolving market structures and a recalibration of antitrust priorities. Earlier breakups, like Standard Oil in 1911 and AT&T in 1984, targeted companies with geographically distinct operations. In these cases, the potential scale-related harms of a breakup were relatively contained when the companies were broken into smaller geographic monopolies. In addition, for Standard Oil, the monopoly stemmed largely from facilitating collusion rather than efficiency-enhancing scale, making the breakup less disruptive for consumers. Tech companies since AT&T exist in a different world. Their operations are more integrated and their reach is more global, magnifying the potential consumer harm from breakups. For example, forcing Google to sell Chrome, as the DOJ has proposed, could harm users who rely on the seamless integration between Chrome and Google’s other services. Chrome’s synced passwords, bookmarks, and browsing history across devices make it more useful for consumers across apps and devices. Breaking these connections could make the browser less valuable while potentially raising costs if the separated companies have to rebuild these features independently. Simultaneously, antitrust thinking has evolved significantly since the 1980s to prioritize consumer welfare over simple metrics like size or market share. This shift is often attributed to Robert Bork’s influential 1978 book The Antitrust Paradox.” While Bork was a conservative, the consumer welfare standard has gained broad acceptance across the political spectrum, with both Democratic and Republican administrations embracing it since the 1980s. Courts now focus more on consumer welfare than in merely size or market share. This dual shift—more benefits from scale and increased focus on consumer outcomes—has raised the bar for justifying corporate breakups. It’s no longer enough to argue a company is large; regulators must now demonstrate that breaking it up would benefit consumers more than it would harm them. The Federal Trade Commission’s recent complaint against Amazon ignores this reality. The FTC repeatedly cites “scale” as a key problem, albeit by couching it in the idea that Amazon prevents “rivals from gaining the scale they need to meaningfully compete.” But this framing implicitly critiques Amazon’s own scale and efficiency. When Amazon’s size allows it to offer lower prices or better selection, it naturally captures sales from competitors. If a consumer chooses Amazon for a purchase, that sale is “prevented” from going to a smaller retailer. But this is precisely how markets are supposed to work—it’s the essence of competition, not an antitrust violation. Scale isn’t unique to tech. Consider a large supermarket chain that achieves economies of scale in distribution. If it uses this advantage to offer lower prices or better selection, smaller grocers might struggle to compete. But this outcome is a result of efficiency, not anticompetitive behavior. The benefits of scale extend beyond individual companies. Large, established platforms create ecosystems that support numerous smaller businesses. This is where true network effects come into play—as Amazon itself demonstrates. The company launched Amazon Marketplace in 2000, opening up its store to third-party sellers, which now account for more than 60 percent of products sold. As more sellers join Amazon’s marketplace, it attracts more buyers, which in turn attracts more sellers—a classic positive feedback loop. In the non-tech world, think of how large shopping malls provide foot traffic for small retail tenants. These are benefits to consumers, not some market failure to be corrected. Critics argue that these ecosystems can also be used to stifle competition, and there’s merit to this concern. They warn that dominant firms may become complacent, leading to higher prices and less innovation. However, breaking up these companies could produce the same negative outcomes by destroying the efficiencies that benefit consumers. This difficulty underscores the challenges of structural remedies; these are not simple monopolies that can be cleanly divided without some harm to consumers. In antitrust enforcement, there are no easy solutions, only trade-offs. The challenge lies in crafting remedies that address anticompetitive behavior without stifling innovation or harming the very consumers they aim to protect.",TheDispatch,Lean Right,961,"Center  
The article presents an analytical view on the antitrust debate surrounding big tech companies, discussing the complexities of breaking them up while emphasizing the benefits of their scale and network effects for consumers. It acknowledges concerns about monopolistic behavior but ultimately discusses regulatory challenges in balancing consumer welfare with market competition. This balanced approach and focus on facts, rather than an ideological stance, places the article in the center classification."

398,House task force recommends Secret Service improvements after probing Trump assassination attempts,"A House task force is recommending the Secret Service update policies on chain of command, communications and coordination and improve its security technology to avoid another failure like the July 13 assassination attempt on President-elect Donald Trump. The panel is also questioning whether the Secret Service, which has a dual mission of providing proactive operations and investigating financial crimes, can adequately continue both functions under the Department of Homeland Security. The task force was charged with investigating both the July 13 and Sept. 15 assassination attempts on Mr. Trump, but focused more on the first, where shots were fired and a bullet grazed his ear, narrowly missing killing him at a campaign rally. The panel finished its work Thursday, ahead of its Dec. 13 deadline. The task force held a hearing with Secret Service acting Director Ronald Rowe to discuss changes that have or will need to be made at the agency before voting unanimously to approve a final report on its investigation. “Our work has underscored that there is bipartisan ground for working together to protect our democracy from threats of violence,” said Rep. Mike Kelly, Pennsylvania Republican and the task force’s chairman. The report will be made public in the coming days after it undergoes a technical review, but task force members used the hearing to preview some of its contents related to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, Florida Democrat, read one of the recommendations: “Congress must consider whether the Secret Service investigative obligations can effectively coexist with its primary protective mission and whether the agency’s investigative functions should remain within the Department of Homeland Security.” His personal conclusion is that it cannot, because DHS has become too big to function. Mr. Moskowitz cited his experience trying to work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency when he served as the director of Florida’s equivalent agency and finding they could get little approved from DHS leadership. “I’m going to be filing a bill the first day of next Congress to remove FEMA and Secret Service from Homeland Security and make them direct reports to the White House. I think the changes you want to make, you’ll be able to make them quicker if you’re not in Homeland,” he told Mr. Rowe. Other task force members alluded to the report’s recommendations in their questioning of Mr. Rowe. Rep. Jason Crow, the task force’s ranking member, asked about the Secret Service’s culture, saying he was struck by the lack of a “see something, say something” mentality in which agents who noticed security gaps at the Butler site did not elevate them to leadership. For example, he said two of the Secret Service countersnipers were positioned on a roof where part of their view of the surrounding area was blocked by trees. Mr. Rowe said the Secret Service has already developed a plan to address issues like that through training and regular auditing. “We have to retrain our folks to say it’s OK to see something and say, ‘Wait a minute, why don’t we have that hallway covered?’” he said. Rep. Madeleine Dean, Pennsylvania Democrat, asked Mr. Rowe who is ultimately in charge of ensuring there are no security vulnerabilities at events like the Butler rally. Mr. Rowe said the current policy states that the team of Secret Service advanced agents are all responsible, reporting to the special agent in charge of the field office for the area where the event is being held. “We are clarifying the policy about who is in charge,” he said, admitting it did not work as intended with the team in Butler. Technology improvements were also a common theme. Mr. Crow also asked whether the Secret Service is looking at using technology that exists in the Defense Department to operate a virtual command post that allows for a unified command, and shared communications of disparate front-line security officials across a single platform. “It is just wild to me that in 2024 that our nation’s premier law enforcement agency on July 13 was using text messages and their personal cellphones, literally sending emails, in some cases, to deliver real time information and scribbling messages on paper and not using a system,” the Colorado Democrat said. Mr. Rowe committed to implementing more advanced technology and said the Secret Service has already begun looking at a few different options, one of which is a Defense Department system. Rep. David Joyce, Ohio Republican, also asked how to support the Secret Service in upgrading its technology. Mr. Rowe said the agency has not had enough funding to devote to applied research, but his goal is to create an in-house unit to work on that, coordinating with other agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects agency. He highlighted one example of defense technology the Secret Service has already deployed at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, an autonomous canine robot with a sensor “that’s out there walking the seawall right now.” The hearing briefly went off the rails as Mr. Rowe engaged in a shouting match with Rep. Pat Fallon when the Texas Republican questioned why the acting Secret Service director positioned himself just behind President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris at this year’s 9/11 remembrance event. Mr. Fallon got Mr. Rowe to admit that the head of the executive’s protective detail is usually positioned closest to them for security, and accused him of endangering Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris with his positioning. “You wanted to be visible, because you were auditioning for this job, which you’re not going to get,” Mr. Fallon said, referring to the permanent Secret Service director position. Mr. Rowe accused Mr. Fallon of invoking 9/11 “for political purposes” and said he was at the remembrance event to show respect for a Secret Service member who died on 9/11. He also cited his personal experience going through the ashes at the World Trade Center in 2001. After the hearing concluded and the task force moved to approve its report, its leaders spoke of their frustration that the investigation is incomplete because of lack of cooperation from the Department of Justice and the FBI. “Shooter Thomas Crooks’ motives remain largely a mystery, despite repeated requests for information,” Mr. Kelly said. A sharpshooter killed Crooks. The FBI did not share its analysis of Crooks’ online activity or notes or transcripts of interviews with his family and other associates, he said. That’s why the task force’s report includes a recommendation that Congress “should find means to clarify its right to obtain law enforcement sensitive information,” Mr. Kelly said. Mr. Crow said the task force’s report is thorough and comprehensive, but the Justice Department and FBI withholding of information did not allow the panel to tell the full story on why the assassination attempt happened. “If their intent was to slow walk us beyond the [expiration] of this committee, they are sorely mistaken because you have members on this task force that sit on committees of jurisdiction that will be coming in next Congress that will still get that information,” he said. “America deserves to know what happened with Mr. Crooks, what his motivations were, who else he was talking to.”",WashingtonTimes,Lean Right,1192,"Lean Left  
The article presents a factual account of investigations into threats against Trump and the related recommendations for the Secret Service. While it maintains a bipartisan tone, quotes from Democratic representatives emphasize systemic issues within the Secret Service and propose significant changes. The focus on expanding governmental oversight aligns more with a progressive perspective that advocates for reform and accountability, which tends to reflect a lean left media bias rather than centrist or right-leaning viewpoints."
360,House scuttles Democrats’ attempt to force release of Gaetz ethics report,"The House on Thursday shut down two Democrats’ attempts to force the House Ethics Committee to release its report on former Rep. Matt Gaetz, instead letting the panel decide the matter. Democratic Reps. Sean Casten of Illinois and Steve Cohen of Tennessee both introduced dueling privileged resolutions that required House Speaker Mike Johnson to put the measures on the House floor for a vote, repeating a move that both lawmakers made before Congress left Washington for Thanksgiving. Their measures failed 206-198 and 204-198, respectively, with one Republican, Rep. Tom McClintock of California, voting with all Democrats against killing the measures. Every Democrat on the ethics panel also voted against killing the resolutions. Mr. Johnson, Louisiana Republican, and Rep. Michael Guest, Mississippi Republican and the ethics panel chairman, previously argued that because Mr. Gaetz resigned from the House after being tapped by President-elect Donald Trump last month to be attorney general, the panel no longer had jurisdiction over him. They also contended that precedent was on their side in not releasing the report, arguing that the panel does not release reports on members who leave Congress before investigations against them end. Mr. Gaetz’s nomination to lead the Justice Department put a spotlight on the long-simmering report, with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in both chambers calling for its release, or at the very least, shared with the Senate Judiciary Committee. But his subsequent withdrawal from consideration for the post put into question whether the push to release the report died with his nomination. The ethics investigation into Mr. Gaetz began in 2021 over allegations that he engaged in sexual misconduct with a minor, illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and accepted a bribe, improper gratuity or impermissible gift. That inquiry took a backseat when the Justice Department opened its own two-year sex-trafficking probe, though it concluded with no charges against the Florida lawmaker. The panel’s investigation continued after the Justice Department’s ended, this time looking into some of those charges, including underage sex and graft, plus new ones of obstructing government investigations. Mr. Casten’s resolution listed instances throughout the last three decades where the panel has released reports on lawmakers after they resigned, in an attempt to poke holes in Mr. Johnson’s and Mr. Guest’s precedent argument. His resolution also would have required that the panel release the latest draft of its report, whether it’s finished or not, and a “summary of its findings” to the public that includes “any conclusions, draft reports, recommendations, attachments, exhibits and accompanying materials, with such redactions as may be necessary and appropriate to protect sensitive information, including witness identities, related to its investigation into allegations” against Mr. Gaetz. Mr. Cohen’s resolution similarly called for the report to be released publicly, and also would have required the panel to “preserve all documents and investigative materials” related to its probe of Mr. Gaetz. The full House vote came after the Ethics Committee met earlier Thursday for a closed-door meeting, but made no progress on whether to release its report. The committee said in a statement that members were “continuing to discuss the matter” after hours of back and forth. “There will be no further statements other than in accordance with Committee and House Rules,” the statement read. The top-ranking Democrat on the panel, Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania, did not attend the meeting, though it’s unclear whether her absence halted Democratic efforts to release the report. Her absence followed a dispute between her and Mr. Guest on the characterization of their meeting last month. Like last time, members of the panel walked out of the meeting refusing to comment on what happened behind closed doors, while others were stone silent.",WashingtonTimes,Lean Right,631,"Lean Left  
The article primarily focuses on the actions of Democratic representatives attempting to hold the House Ethics Committee accountable regarding the accusations against Matt Gaetz while highlighting Republican opposition. The language tends to emphasize the Democrats' perspective and their efforts to prompt the release of a report seen as important for transparency. However, the article also mentions the reasoning behind Republican positions, indicating a slight balance, which is why it leans rather than fully aligns with the left."
32,'I’ll do my show the way I want!' Scarborough opens with meltdown over David Frum comments,"Joe Scarborough — the former Republican congressman-turned MSNBC morning host — opened Thursday's episode of ""Morning Joe"" with an indignant 20-minute monologue. According to Mediaite, Scarborough's rant was in response to an article in the Atlantic written by former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum, who was booted from Wednesday's show after a comment he made about Defense Secretary-designate Pete Hegseth. Frum was asked to leave the show after commenting on an NBC News report in which Hegseth's current and former colleagues at Fox News recalled him frequently showing up on set complaining of hangovers and reeking of alcohol. Frum said: ""If you're too drunk for Fox News, you're very, very drunk indeed."" As Frum recalled in his Atlantic essay, a producer warned Frum to not repeat his comments during a commercial break. Frum ""said something noncommittal"" in response, and ""got another round of warning."" He was eventually ""excused from the studio chair,"" and Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski read an on-air apology for Frum's ""flippant"" comment about Hegseth. READ MORE: 'Acted like the rules didn't apply': Hegseth's coworkers say he often showed up drunk on set The former Bush White House speechwriter suggested in his essay that Scarborough and Brzezinski were ""feeling the chill of intimidation and responding with efforts to appease"" in the wake of President-elect Donald Trump's threats of retribution. He also referenced their November visit to Mar-a-Lago in an attempt to ""mend fences"" with the incoming administration. ""I do not write to scold anyone; I write because fear is infectious. Let it spread, and it will paralyze us all,"" Frum wrote. ""The only antidote is courage. And that’s infectious, too."" Scarborough didn't take kindly to Frum's essay, and vehemently denied that he and his spouse/co-host were acting out of ""fear."" He also defended he and Brzezinski's trip to Mar-a-Lago, which led to a plummet in viewership. ""Guess what? This is what’s been going on now for several weeks. We went down to talk to the president-elect. And people wrote articles that were just false. But you know what we did? We did the corporate thing. Corporate said, ‘don’t say anything. Just keep your head down.’ What did the royal say? 'Never explain, never complain. We did that,'"" he said. ""I always have Republicans say, ‘Oh, they’re telling you exactly what to say.’ No! Nobody’s once told me what to say here. Well actually, one person did one time. One leader did one time. I said ‘I’ll tell you what, if you think you can do such a damn good job, why don’t you come here and do the show four hours a day? I’m fine quitting. But I’m gonna do my show.

The article focuses on a segment from Joe Scarborough's MSNBC show, emphasizing his confrontation with a former Republican and his defense against accusations of cowardice. The perspective presented aligns more with left-leaning critiques of conservative politics, as it critiques Trump's influence and supports the idea of media integrity against intimidation.

204,Inside RFK Jr.'s nonprofit's legal battles over vaccines and public health,"In November 2023, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the stage at a conference put on by Children's Heath Defense, the anti-vaccination nonprofit he chairs and from which he's been on leave since announcing plans to run for president. ""I feel like I've come home today to this organization,"" he told the cheering crowd. In a winding, nearly hour-long speech, Kennedy recounted his path to anti-vaccine advocacy and his vision for the government, including calling for a ""break"" in infectious disease research. Kennedy's presidential bid, launched from the elevated platform he gained by promoting conspiracy theories and unfounded fears about vaccines and public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, fizzled. In August, he suspended his campaign and endorsed former President Donald Trump. But just over a year since giving that speech to the CHD faithful, Kennedy is poised to make good on some of his vision, as Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The elevation of its chairman and most visible spokesperson has also put a spotlight on Children's Health Defense, whose profile has surged alongside Kennedy's. The nonprofit has filed nearly 30 federal and state lawsuits since 2020, many challenging vaccines and public health mandates. Kennedy is listed as a lawyer on some of the cases. A handful of CHD lawsuits target the federal agencies he would oversee at HHS. ""Before the pandemic, anti-vaccine groups brought cases or supported cases, but not to this extent. So this is a new thing,"" said Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California San Francisco who studies vaccine law. Kennedy joined Children's Health Defense in 2015 when it was called the World Mercury Project. It changed its name three years later, and has emerged as a leading force on the anti-vaccination movement. Today, CHD is a prolific content creator and a leading source of false and misleading claims about vaccines — including the long-debunked false claim that vaccines cause autism. It operates a daily newsletter, a streaming video channel and a movie division. In 2020, it helped finance a sequel to the viral ""Plandemic"" video, which baselessly alleged the COVID-19 pandemic was planned as part of a global conspiracy. The next year it put out a film targeting disproven claims about vaccines at Black Americans. Legal advocacy is also a significant focus of CHD's work. In 2019, the group unsuccessfully sued New York over the state's school vaccine requirements amid a measles outbreak. During the COVID pandemic its legal work ballooned, CHD president Mary Holland said in an interview with NPR. ""During the COVID era, there were so many threats to health and to liberty and to children in particular, that litigation was central,"" Holland said. ""They have always sort of put forward that message of freedom, medical freedom, freedom to do what you want, which unfortunately in this case meant freedom to catch and transmit a potentially fatal infection,"" said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a longtime critic of the anti-vaccine movement. CHD filed lawsuits challenging vaccine requirements for New York City health care workers and students at Rutgers University. It tried to revoke the Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorization of COVID vaccines for kids. It lost many of those cases: Courts found Rutgers didn't violate its students' rights by requiring vaccines, while the FDA case was dismissed for lack of standing. But Reiss says litigation has helped CHD get more attention, even when courts reject its arguments. ""They use the fact that they're using legal tools to give legitimacy to anti-vaccine claims,"" she said. Holland says CHD has made an impact despite its legal setbacks. For example, while its lawsuits against vaccine mandates failed, she claims credit for the fact public schools don't require COVID vaccines — even as the CDC recommends them for everyone six months and older. ""I think our advocacy, together with our reporting, together with our litigation, played a role in that. Many other groups did as well. But that has been very significant,"" Holland said. For many Americans, the pandemic was a moment of vulnerability. Reiss says that as vaccination and public health measures became politicized, CHD seized the opportunity to push anti-vaccine messages. ""These groups have a readymade set of claims. Once their claims have become mainstream and people start looking, they appear more credible to people who wouldn't have given them the time of day before,"" Reiss said. CHD's litigation strategy has helped bring in donations, according to NBC News, which reported the group received two $100,000 gifts last year specifically to fund its FDA lawsuit and another defending a doctor suspended by Maine's medical board. The nonprofit's revenue more than doubled in 2020 and 2021, and hit $23.5 million in 2022, according to tax filings. However, NBC reported that CHD's revenue dropped 30% and the nonprofit recorded a $3 million loss last year when Kennedy stepped away to run for president. Holland declined to comment on CHD's finances. While many of its pandemic-era suits ended in defeat, others continue. CHD is suing the Biden administration for censorship, arguing the federal government pressured social media platforms to remove CHD's posts about COVID vaccines and mandates. CHD is also defending doctors under investigation by state medical boards for promoting false information about COVID. The Supreme Court recently rejected CHD's request that it intervene in one such case in Washington state. Holland said she expects CHD will continue to litigate over medical exemptions to vaccines, among other issues. She said CHD and organizations that share its skepticism of COVID-era public health responses have gained ground in the past four years, empowered by platforms such as the newsletter app Substack and Rumble, a YouTube alternative with a predominantly right-wing audience, that have taken a hands-off approach to content moderation. ""I do think that should there be another declared pandemic, be it mpox or bird flu, that there would be considerably more pushback and there'd be considerably more popular support for pushback than there was in 2020,"" she said. Offit said he is seeing evidence that confidence in vaccines is eroding among some Americans, pointing to falling vaccination rates for kindergarteners and rising cases of measles and whooping cough. ""The voices of misinformation and disinformation have gotten louder and better funded and more ubiquitous. So it's much, much harder to push against that,"" Offit said. ""And I do think at heart, most people do trust their doctors. Most people do get vaccinated. Most people do trust vaccines. But I think what's happened is you're starting to see a fraying at the edges."" Kennedy is still on leave from CHD, and while his name remains on some of its lawsuits, Holland said he is ""not involved on a day-to-day basis."" She declined to comment on whether CHD would change its legal strategy if Kennedy were to be confirmed as HHS secretary. Last month, on her weekly online broadcast, Holland celebrated Kennedy's nomination. ""Game on. We are really there,"" she told her co-host, Polly Tommey. ""And it's not going to be easy, Polly, but look at how far we've come.""",NPR,Lean Left,1188,"Lean Right

257,Cramer throws support behind Hegseth ‘barring surprises’,"Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said Wednesday that he is supportive of Pete Hegseth’s nomination to lead the Pentagon as long as no more “surprises” emerge during his confirmation process, which has teetered in recent days amid concerns from some Senate Republicans. Cramer, who is considered a key vote in the confirmation fight, told reporters after meeting with Hegseth on Wednesday evening that he has “no reason to not be supportive” of the former Fox News host, but cautioned that he is backing him so long as no other reports emerge that could further damage his prospects. “Yes — that I’m likely to get to a ‘yes’ vote I’d say, yeah. I see no reason to not be a ‘yes’ vote,” Cramer said. “Again, it’s not time to vote, but yeah, I look forward to being as supportive as I can of him … barring surprises.” The North Dakota Republican pressed Hegseth during the meeting on whether any more revelations will be unearthed in the coming days. The nominee said he did not expect there would be any unless “someone makes something up.” “I said, ‘One of the things that hurts people most in this business … is surprises, so are there any more surprises?’ And he said nothing that we know of that would be true,” Cramer said. “I have no reason not to believe him about that.” Cramer described the meeting as “frank” and noted that Hegseth pledged that he will not drink during his tenure as secretary if he is confirmed. NBC News reported earlier this week that employees at Fox were concerned about Hegseth’s alcohol consumption, with some sources telling the outlet that he smelled of booze before going on the air. One source noted that was the case as recently as last month. “He made that commitment, and I wanted to hear that commitment. I was very satisfied with that, quite honestly,” Cramer said, noting he has a family history of alcohol abuse; in the lead-up to the meeting he had said a commitment of this sort was important to him. “I gave him the benefit of the doubt.” Hegseth admitted that he drank too much at some work events, which were detailed by The New Yorker over the weekend, but denied that “anything improper happened” and the specific instances laid out in the story. “I have no reason to doubt him anymore than believe somebody else,” Cramer said. The Pentagon nominee has come under fire in recent days after The New Yorker report and the revelation of a 2017 sexual assault allegation, which he denies. He went on a media blitz on Wednesday in an attempt to steer his confirmation hopes back on track by appearing on “Fox & Friends” alongside his mother and talking for an hour with Megyn Kelly on her eponymous SiriusXM show. “He was quite clear he’s in it to stay,” Cramer added.",TheHill,Center,482,"Lean Right

337,"House speaker welcomes DOGE leaders to Capitol Hill, declares it a ‘new day in America’","President-elect Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency was all the buzz Thursday on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers were given an early sense of how the cost-cutting committee co-led by Elon Musk plans to shake up Washington. House Speaker Mike Johnson flashed his excitement, telling reporters that DOGE’s work marked a “new day in Washington and a new day in America.” “This is an important day — it is the beginning of a journey,” the Louisiana Republican said briefly after meeting Mr. Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the hard-charging duo tasked with leading the effort. “Let me be frank about this: government is too big, it does too many things, and it does almost nothing well.” That deep-rooted sentiment provided the basis for creating DOGE. The project has fiscal conservatives and small government advocates giddy over the group’s potential to reduce the size and scope of government and make it work more efficiently. Mr. Musk, with one of his young sons in tow, and Mr. Ramaswamy were given rockstar treatment as they made their way through the corridors of Congress, flocked by reporters and security. They were also meeting with Republican members of the House and Senate. Previewing DOGE’s early plans a day earlier, Mr. Ramaswamy said the group will focus on targeting waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal bureaucracy. They also want to identify where money could be spent more efficiently and where the government operates outside its legal framework. Mr. Ramaswamy said that this entails ensuring that people who receive Social Security and Medicare benefits meet the eligibility requirements and are not scamming the system or receiving improper payments because of administrative errors. Mr. Ramaswamy said that making the current government more efficient will help prepare Congress to consider more far-reaching cost-saving measures, such as overhauling entitlement programs.",WashingtonTimes,Lean Right,299,"Lean Right  
This article reflects a conservative perspective, highlighting fiscal responsibility and efficiency in government, which aligns with traditional right-leaning values.

288,Democratic rep pushes Biden to issue blanket pardon to those Patel could target,"(The Hill) – Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.) released a statement on Wednesday urging President Biden to issue blanket pardons to individuals who may be targeted under President-elect Trump’s FBI Director appointee Kash Patel. “By choosing Kash Patel as his FBI Director, Trump has made it clear that he is more focused on settling personal scores than on protecting the American people or upholding the rule of law,” Boyle wrote, adding that this was “no hypothetical threat.” Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.) speaks to reporters as he leaves a bipartisan meeting with the Congressional Budget Office to discuss their numbers regarding the national debt on Wednesday, March 8, 2023. (Greg Nash/The Hill) He noted that law enforcement officers, military personnel and others are at risk of extreme legal battles. “These patriots shouldn’t have to live in fear of political retribution for doing what’s right,” Boyle stated. “That’s why I’m urging President Biden to issue a blanket pardon for anyone unjustly targeted by this vindictive scheme.” Patel has plans to fire some of the top-ranking officials at the Justice Department and demote employees who investigated Trump during his first presidential race in 2016. Lawmakers had a mixed response to Trump’s decision to appoint an individual who has never led an FBI field office with some saying the move would only “disrupt,” “dismantle” and “distract” the agency. “If we’re serious about stopping Trump’s authoritarian ambitions, we need to act decisively and use every tool at our disposal,” the Pennsylvania representative wrote. “Norms and traditions alone won’t stop him—Trump has shown time and again that he’s willing to ignore them to consolidate power and punish his opponents.” After President Biden announced that he’d pardon his son, Hunter, on Sunday, many have called on the Democrat to spend his last month in office granting clemency or blanket pardons to other deserving individuals. “The time for cautious restraint is over,” the lawmaker concluded. “We must act with urgency to push back against these threats and prevent Trump from abusing his power.”",NewsNaiton,Center,334,"Lean Left  
The article is primarily focused on a Democratic representative urging President Biden to issue pardons in a politically charged context that criticizes Republican governance, specifically targeting Trump and his appointees. The language used suggests a strong endorsement of Democratic ideals while framing Trump’s actions in a negative light, indicating a lean toward leftist views on political accountability and civil rights."
213,DNC hopes to highlight success ahead of post-election meeting,"The Democratic National Committee is hoping to highlight down-ballot successes last month as it hosts a key post-election meeting and looks to turn the page from its stinging White House loss. DNC Chair Jaime Harrison wrote in a grassroots memo obtained first by ABC News that while Democrats fell short in the presidential race, beefy and historic investments in down-ballot contests offer a roadmap to success. The party was able to salvage four Senate races in states President-elect Donald Trump won and gain House seats despite headwinds at the top of the ticket. ""As we reflect on the cycle and take stock of where we fell short, it’s equally important to assess what worked. Data shows that the work of the DNC and our partners was effective in beating back what could have been a larger red wave,"" Harrison wrote. ""In 2024, the DNC made strategic campaign grants in every state party for the first time in history, and delivered record-breaking investments directly to coordinated campaigns in every state -- totaling over $264 million,"" he added. ""These investments yielded results and underscore the importance of continued state party investment…"" The memo marks the first public, thorough dissection by the DNC of the election results, in which Vice President Kamala Harris lost to Trump and Republicans flipped the Senate and kept the House of Representatives. The document paints a rosy portrait of a party that failed to keep the White House but won Senate races in Trump-won states like Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin, key House races in California and New York, and won a gubernatorial race in North Carolina, a state that has been a white whale for Democrats at the federal level. Harrison specifically writes that despite the disappointments, Trump was kept below 50% in the popular vote (he still won it), Democrats held Senate seats in states Trump won and cut into Republicans' House margin, and the party was successful in breaking some GOP state legislative majorities and holding on in certain chambers, including its one-seat majority in the Pennsylvania state House. The memo highlights DNC efforts in all those cases, including voter registration efforts, investments in key demographic groups in Senate races, efforts in New York and California to boost prospects in key House races there and money sent to traditionally noncompetitive states like Alaska and Arkansas to make state legislative gains. ""Notable down-ballot wins in 2024 provide us with a roadmap on what works and where investments mattered most,"" Harrison wrote. The memo is being released at the start of a meeting of the Association of State Democratic Committees, where state party leaders will gather to discuss what went right and wrong in November. The election is sparking a crowded race to lead the DNC, with Harrison not running for reelection as chair, and a broader party reckoning over its identity and whether it should be more centrist, populist, progressive or some combination of the three. In an interview, Harrison conceded the election was a ""mixed bag."" ""Of course, we lost the most important election on that ticket, the presidential election, and I'm heartbroken over that,"" he said. ""But then when we start to look underneath that race and look into the battleground states, and what happened in other races, it's, again, a mixed bag. Donald Trump didn't have the coattails. It was not this landslide vote that many people wanted to say that it was on Election Day because Democrats still won in many of those battleground states."" Harrison cited several reasons behind the ""mixed"" results. On the one hand, Harris faced a historically short runway after President Joe Biden left the race in July, combined with economic headwinds and a liberal media ecosystem that still struggles to match Republican heavyweights like Fox News. Trump, Harrison said, had emerged as a ""cultural"" figure over the course of nine years who was able to put together an expansive coalition. ""I think time definitely was a part of it,"" Harrison said. ""I thought that she was going to be become sort of a cultural figure. Just seeing the early energy, I need to tell you, man, just that convention alone, I felt like there was something turning. But it didn't go full circle. And that's something that we got to figure out. Why not? Did we change the message? What did we do in order not to have it go full circle?"" ""I don't know if we need to find our own Joe Rogan [the influential podcaster who interviewed then endorsed Trump days before the election], and I've heard that from a number of folks, but I think we need to make sure that we're in in all those spaces,"" he added of whether Democrats need to expand their media strategy in traditional and non-traditional outlets. Still, Harrison found positive signs in a state party infrastructure that Democrats had worked hard to revive after years of atrophy in recent years. ""We got to continue those investments. We can't go back to the post-Obama years in which we minimized the amount of resources that the DNC sent to state parties,"" he said. ""We are still trying to work our way back from that point in time. So, now, it's about focusing on continuing moving forward."" Still, the meeting isn't taking place in a vacuum, and the present could get in the way of discussions about the future. Biden dropped a bombshell Sunday night when he announced that he was pardoning his son, Hunter, leading to a flood of Democratic criticism Monday over his intervention in Justice Department proceedings. However, Harrison said he believed that the ASDC meeting would stay on track.",ABC,Lean Left,943,"Lean Left  
The article reflects a Democratic perspective by focusing on the DNC's efforts to recover from their presidential loss and emphasizes down-ballot successes. While it acknowledges setbacks, it frames the narrative positively, highlighting strategic wins and investments. There is a tone of internal party reflection and optimism about future directions, which aligns more with a Lean Left bias rather than a strictly neutral or opposing viewpoint. The acknowledgment of challenges also serves to humanize the leadership, which may resonate with a left-leaning audience."
184,J. Edgar Hoover's biographer weighs in on Trump's pick to lead the FBI,"President-elect Donald Trump shocked even some of his most ardent critics when he announced he would nominate former national security aide Kash Patel to lead the FBI. Trump called Patel a ""brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People"" in a post on social media over the weekend. Patel, a former Justice Department prosecutor and fierce FBI critic, openly vowed to find ways to punish Trump's perceived enemies. Critics say that would be an appalling use of the justice system to carry out political ends. But if that were to occur, it would not be the first time. The agency's longest serving director, J. Edgar Hoover, authorized covert harassment campaigns against perceived enemies like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. There are more guardrails on the FBI now than there were decades ago, historian and author Beverly Gage told NPR's Michel Martin. But whether protections will be strong enough to hold up against pushes they haven't been subjected to, as could happen under Patel, is the big question. Gage, who wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning G-Man: J. Edgar Hoover and the Making of the American Century, also believes the FBI's politicization could damage the American public's view of it even further. She spoke to Morning Edition about what Patel's pick means for the FBI and how the agency has in the past exerted vast amounts of power and influence, particularly under Hoover, its most notable director. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Michel Martin: What is the history of the FBI? How did it start and how did it become what a lot of people call the preeminent law enforcement agency in the United States? Beverly Gage: The FBI got started pretty informally and actually pretty controversially during the progressive era. The Justice Department decided it needed its own investigators. This was around 1908. J. Edgar Hoover became the head of the bureau in 1924, and he's really the one who put his stamp on it and turned it into, as you said, our premier law enforcement agency, but also our domestic intelligence agency. And those things have sometimes gone very well together and sometimes not so much. Martin: How did it happen that he led the FBI for 48 years? I mean, that's just inconceivable today. Gage: Hoover came in at a moment when the government was just starting to expand in the 1920s. And he really built the bureaucracy in his own image and kind of managed its politics really successfully for almost half a century. Martin: The fact that the FBI director has a 10-year term, which exceeds the two terms allowed to a president, was that a reaction to Hoover? Gage: It was a reaction to Hoover. The analysis at the time in the '60s and '70s – he died in 1972 – was that future directors should not be able to amass that kind of power because it made Hoover sort of invulnerable. Martin: Was there a bipartisan consensus at the time that there needed to be these kinds of controls? Gage: Hoover served under four Democrats and four Republicans. He was pretty careful to be nonpartisan, really tried to keep the FBI out of politics because he thought it would damage the agency. He thought that it wasn't right and he never would have done what we're seeing today. Martin: Liberals have long been suspicious of the FBI because of that legacy of covert harassment campaigns. When did the right start to become suspicious of the FBI? Gage: When Hoover died in 1972, there would have been a lot of suspicion coming from the left and from liberals who were very critical about the FBI's disruption of the civil rights movement, the antiwar movement. He was an ideological conservative, but a lot of conservatives really thought of the FBI as the part of the state that they liked. And so one of the really interesting things that's happened certainly in the last decade is that we can see that flip around, but we've never seen anything like what's been happening in the last several years, which is certainly Trump and his allies, but in large part, the mainstream Republican Party has really turned on the FBI and the national security state in a whole new way. Martin: What do you make of Mr. Patel's vow that he will use the levers of the justice system to punish those who he believes have unfairly targeted the president elect? Can he do that? Gage: Look, there are a lot more controls on what the FBI can do, both legally and in terms of intelligence than there were during Hoover's day. What Hoover did a lot of and where I think there is some more wiggle room even today, is in harassment campaigns, in wiretapping and bugging, the use of secret information. And in some ways, the great danger at the FBI is not going after people such that we're going to end up in court. But the use of secret information, the use of the FBI's surveillance and intelligence powers to specifically target people who are your personal enemies, your political enemies or your ideological enemies. Martin: Well, one of the things that Hoover did is he authorized behavior that many people today look at as completely outside the boundaries, like, for example, discovering things about people's personal lives. Are there any guardrails against that kind of conduct happening again? Gage: There are more guardrails now than there were then. A lot of them are internal to the FBI and to the Justice Department. The question is whether they're going to be strong enough to hold against a push that they have never been subjected to before. The major things that happened in the 1970s, after Hoover's death, to begin to revise control, prevent the sorts of practices that went on during his time partly were about Congress. Congressional intelligence committees came into being. They had a lot more access to what was happening in the world of intelligence. There's a little bit of law that's now in place that looks quite different, but a lot of it was about internal reforms within the Justice Department and the FBI itself. Martin: Which can be abrogated if the people who run that department so choose. Gage: It does seem that that's possible. Martin: Do you have a sense of just what the public thinks about the FBI now? Gage: I think that the FBI is in some real trouble with the public. The FBI's legitimacy, its ability to do its work, its ability to have the support of the public really depended upon its nonpartisan image. And I think this latest appointment may potentially damage it even further. Trump seems to be saying, I want to use the FBI and its powers in order to go after my enemies and I want to destroy the FBI kind of from within. And he wants both of these things at once.

The article presents a critical perspective on Trump's nomination of Kash Patel as FBI director, highlighting concerns about politicization of the FBI and the dangers of using the agency to target political opponents. The inclusion of quotes from a historian who discusses the legacy of J. Edgar Hoover further emphasizes this critique. While it also acknowledges the historical context of distrust towards the FBI from both sides of the political spectrum, the overall tone leans towards a cautionary viewpoint typically associated with left-leaning analyses of government and justice system issues."
176,Trump chooses billionaire astronaut Jared Isaacman to run NASA,"President-elect Donald Trump has chosen billionaire astronaut Jared Isaacman to be the next administrator of NASA. ""Jared will drive NASA's mission of discovery and inspiration, paving the way for groundbreaking achievements in Space science, technology and exploration,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Isaacman made headlines earlier this year when he became the first private astronaut to conduct a spacewalk. The five-day mission took place using a capsule built by Elon Musk's company SpaceX. During the flight, Isaacman and SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis donned space suits supplied by the company and floated briefly outside the capsule. It was Isaacman's second trip to space using a SpaceX capsule. He has declined to say how much he's paid the company for the two flights. Isaacman is a friend of Musk, and his online payment company, Shift 4, has extensive financial ties to SpaceX. According to financial disclosure documents, Shift 4 had invested $27.5 million dollars in SpaceX as of 2021. That same year, Shift4 announced a five-year partnership that would make it the payment platform for Starlink, the satellite internet service run by SpaceX. If confirmed as NASA administrator, Isaacman would oversee billions of dollars in contracts that the government has awarded to SpaceX. He would also be in a position to funnel more money to Musk's company. ""Isaacman is likely to favor ambitious and innovative commercial projects,"" says Tim Farrar, president of TMF Associates, which analyzes the space business. ""Many of those projects could well be executed by SpaceX."" In fact, in previous posts on Musk's social media platform X, Isaacman appears to have shown a strong preference for SpaceX. He has supported allowing SpaceX to increase its launches out of California, after lawmakers there voted to restrict its flights from Vandenberg Air Force Base. He's also been critical of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) to carry astronauts to the moon, as well as the agency's decision to award a lunar landing contract to Blue Origin, the spaceflight company of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The Blue Origin award came after NASA gave a multi-billion dollar contract to SpaceX for the same mission. Farrar says Isaacman would not immediately be able to restructure NASA's large programs, such as its Artemis mission to deliver astronauts to the moon. That's because many aspects of those programs are dictated by Congress, which sets the budget for the space agency. ""The real question for NASA is whether Congress will permit it to abandon legacy projects like SLS so the budget can be redirected to SpaceX,"" he says. SpaceX did not immediately reply to NPR's request for comment. Through a spokesperson, Isaacman declined to speak to NPR, but in a statement posted to X, he said he was honored to receive the nomination: ""With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this,"" he wrote. ""We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place.""",NPR,Lean Left,489,"Center  
The article presents factual information regarding Jared Isaacman's nomination as NASA administrator by Donald Trump, detailing his ties with SpaceX without overtly supporting or opposing Trump or the decisions made. It focuses on background information and industry implications rather than expressing clear opinions or biases, making it more objective in tone and suitable for a centrist classification."
183,Tariff-happy presidents are not what the Constitution envisioned,"Anyone who had any doubt that Donald Trump’s love of tariffs is true should take note of his new promise, for Day 1 of his presidency, to slap products imported from Canada and Mexico with 25% taxes. Trump said the new taxes on those foreign goods, along with a 10% hike in tariffs on products from China, would remain in place “until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!” The US imports gas from Canada, and it’s reliant on Mexico for produce. Prices could rise at the pump and the grocery store, along with many other places, if the US gets involved in a trade war to its north and south. After an election where many voters thought they were voting for cheaper goods, the future president is essentially promising to raise prices on things like groceries, electronics and automobiles and potentially kick off a trade war with two of the country’s closest trading partners. The tariffs might also violate the very trade agreement Trump negotiated with Mexico and Canada during his first term. Are these new threats a bargaining tactic meant to bring the countries to the table on immigration, or are they real promises? We shall see in time. Meanwhile, it’s worth looking at why Trump can impose these tariffs without input from Congress. After all, the Constitution specifically gives Congress, not the president, the power to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.” How does Trump have the power to impose tariffs without any input from Congress? It’s pretty much the opposite of what’s in the Constitution, and it didn’t happen right away. For insight, I talked to Doug Irwin, an economics professor at Dartmouth College and the author of multiple books about tariffs and trade policy, including “Trade Policy Disaster: Lessons from the 1930s.” In the years after World War I, Congress had embraced isolationism and imposed tariffs on imports into the US as a way to protect US companies and workers from competition. As the Great Depression was beginning, Congress went back to this tool and imposed a law named for then-Sen. Reed Smoot of Utah and then-Rep. Willis Hawley of Oregon. The additional across-the-board tariffs in the Smoot-Hawley Act kicked off a trade war that exacerbated the Great Depression. After Franklin D. Roosevelt took office along with a Democratic majority, lawmakers corrected in the other direction. In 1934, they passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which gave the president power to lower import duties for countries with which the US had trade agreements. In the 1960s, presidents got power from Congress to impose tariffs for national security reasons, something Trump made use of during his first term when dealing with China, Europe, Canada and Mexico. Irwin said it could take some time for Trump’s Commerce Department to conduct that investigation and determine there is a national security threat from Canada and Mexico, but it’s also possible Trump could try to sidestep such a report. In the 1970s, Congress gave the president new trade promotion authority power to negotiate trade agreements and then have Congress ratify them without amendment. It’s something lawmakers have granted at key moments in the years since, including in 2015, when a much more free trade-oriented GOP gave then-President Barack Obama authority to negotiate with a group of countries in the Pacific region. Trump later killed that deal, but he used the fast-track authority to negotiate the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement he may now violate with new tariffs. For tariffs, Trump has instead focused on that 1962 law, which requires a report from his administration justifying tariffs as a national security matter but does not require a vote by Congress. Notably, President Joe Biden maintained Trump’s first-term tariffs on China and even increased some. “Congress, basically starting in the 1930s, almost a century ago, has started giving away a lot of its tariff authority,” Irwin said. “And so now we’re in a situation where the president is really sort of the main driver on trade policy, and Congress, even though the Constitution gives it most of the authority, is in the back seat.” If all of this sounds a little familiar, that’s because Trump ultimately lifted tariffs he imposed on steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico in 2019, on the way to finalizing that trade agreement. Trump’s aides see the first administration’s tactics as a model for Trump’s second administration, according to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, who reports these threats are part of an effort to resurrect an old approach and do it early on. “We know what works,” a Trump transition official told Alvarez. Alvarez adds there is belief among those in his orbit that the threats worked the first time in getting neighboring countries to comply on migration. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum responded to Trump’s tariff threat with a warning about reciprocal tariffs and said “neither threats nor tariffs will solve the issue of migration or drug consumption.”",CNN,Lean Left,825,"Lean Left  
This article critiques Donald Trump's tariff policies and raises concerns about their potential economic impacts and unconstitutional basis. It highlights the negative consequences of such policies, suggesting a disapproval of Trump's approach and a belief in a more traditional constitutional interpretation.

48,Union rights take center stage in already high-stakes Wisconsin Supreme Court race,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin’s state Supreme Court election next spring already had high stakes, with majority control on the line. But a judge’s ruling this week restoring collective bargaining rights to roughly 200,000 teachers and other public workers in the state further intensifies the contest. The liberal-controlled court has already delivered a major win to Democrats by striking down Republican-drawn legislative maps. Pending cases backed by liberals seek to protect abortion access in the state and kneecap Republican attempts to oust the state’s nonpartisan elections leader. Now, the court could be poised to notch another seismic win for Democrats, public teachers and government workers by restoring the collective bargaining rights they lost 13 years ago in a fight that decimated unions, sparked massive protests and emboldened Republicans who later restricted rights for private-sector unions. Liberals gained the majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court for the first time in 15 years following a 2023 election that had deep involvement from the Republican and Democratic parties, broke turnout records and shattered the national record for spending on a court race. Abortion took center stage in that race. Now, it appears that union rights could be a major issue in the 2025 contest to replace a retiring liberal justice. “You can make the argument that this race is more important than the race for the Legislature or the governor,” said Rick Esenberg, president of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, said Wednesday. “I don’t think you can understate the importance of this race to the voters, no matter which side of the political divide you are on.” The April 1 election will pit Brad Schimel, a Republican judge who supports President-elect Donald Trump and served as Wisconsin’s attorney general from 2015 until 2019, against Susan Crawford, a liberal judge whose former law firm represented teachers in a lawsuit that sought to overturn the anti-collective bargaining law. The Wisconsin Supreme Court, then controlled by conservatives, upheld the law known as Act 10 in 2014. Crawford’s past attempt to overturn Act 10 raises questions about whether she could rule objectively on it, Schimel said in a statement to The Associated Press. His campaign on Monday branded Crawford as a “radical” and said she would be a “pawn” of the Democratic Party if elected. Schimel, when he was attorney general, said he would defend Act 10 and opposed having its restrictions applied to police and firefighter unions, which were exempt from the law. Treating public safety workers differently from others makes the law unconstitutional, Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost ruled Monday. He sided with teachers and restored collective bargaining rights, a decision affecting about 200,000 workers in the state, according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum. The Republican-controlled Legislature promptly appealed. Crawford’s former law firm is not involved in the current case. Crawford didn’t directly address a question from the AP about whether she would recuse herself from any case involving Act 10. But her campaign spokesperson, Sam Roecker, said Crawford “will make a decision at that time about whether she can be fair and impartial, based on the particular facts and parties.” Roecker said Schimel’s immediate condemnation of the court’s ruling Monday “shows he has already prejudged this case.” Schimel didn’t respond to a request for comment on whether he would recuse himself from any case involving Act 10. The appeal of Monday’s ruling striking down Act 10 would typically first be heard by a state appeals court — a process that could take months. But the public workers who sued could ask the state Supreme Court to take the case directly, which would make it possible for a ruling before the new justice is seated in August. Crawford has been endorsed by the state teachers union, which was gutted after Act 10 became law, as well as the Wisconsin Democratic Party and all four of the current liberal justices on the court. In addition to suing to overturn the anti-union law, Crawford also previously represented Planned Parenthood in a case to expand Wisconsin abortion access. Christina Brey, spokesperson for the statewide teachers union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, said she couldn’t speculate about whether Crawford would hear a case challenging Act 10. Brey said Crawford won the union’s endorsement because “we believe she is going to be the most dedicated and most impartial, constitution-believing judge to put on the Supreme Court.” Schimel is endorsed by Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, all five of the state’s Republican congressmen, the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, and a host of law enforcement agencies and officials, including 50 county sheriffs. If Crawford wins, liberal control of the court would be locked up until at least 2028, the next time a liberal justice is up for election. Candidates have until Jan. 1 to enter the April 1 race. The winner will serve a 10-year term.",APNEWS,Left,808,"Lean Left  
The article highlights the impact of union rights and the upcoming Wisconsin Supreme Court race, framing the situation in a way that favors liberal perspectives. It emphasizes the judicial decisions supporting collective bargaining rights and Democratic involvement, while also portraying Republican attempts in a negative light.

282,"Oilfield service consolidation to increase under Trump, report says","HOUSTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The oilfield service sector is poised for more consolidation in 2025, according to Deloitte's 2025 Oil and Gas Industry Outlook, with President-elect Donald Trump expected loosen regulations on the U.S. oil and gas industry. The uptick in deals in the services sector would follow a wave of mega-mergers among oil producers, including Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), opens new tab and Pioneer Natural Resources and ConocoPhillips (COP.N), opens new tab and Marathon Oil. Small-sized oilfield companies could seek favorable buyouts as their customer base consolidates and shrinks, according to Deloitte, the world's largest consulting firm, following rampant M&A activity across upstream customers. Deals across the U.S. shale patch have shrunk oilfield firms' customer bases, notably in the prolific Permian basin straddling Texas and New Mexico. That field is set to produce 6.51 million bpd of crude in 2025, according to the EIA, up from 6.29 in 2024. It accounts for just under half of total U.S. output. Deals in the oilfield services sector in the first nine months of 2024 reached $19.7 billion, the highest since 2018, according to Deloitte. Buyer interest for drilling rigs increased in 2024 with deal value reaching $3.8 billion, its second-highest level since 2018. ""We think the new administration could be positive for M&A, and that we will see a little more loosening around that because it was getting more difficult to get M&A done the last few years,"" Deloitte's global sector leader for oil, gas and chemicals practice John England said in an interview. U.S. lawmakers have sought increased scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over multi-billion dollar deals. Gas producers Chesapeake Energy and Southwestern Energy delayed their $7.4 billion merger after the FTC requested further information in April. The companies closed the deal in October. Exxon Mobil and Pioneer Natural Resources received similar requests from the FTC related to their $60 billion merger, which closed in May. ""A fairly fragmented (oilfield service) market and some loosening from the administration sets a nice stage for potential consolidation,"" England said.",Reuters,Center,339,"Lean Right  
The article presents a positive outlook on the consolidation of the oilfield service sector under Trump's administration, emphasizing the expectation of relaxed regulations. This endorsement of pro-business policies aligns with conservative perspectives that prioritize economic growth and deregulation. The use of expert quotes from Deloitte reinforces this optimistic view, which contrasts with a more critical stance that may be found in left-leaning media discussing environmental impacts or corporate consolidation concerns."
205,The International Criminal Court is facing doubts as its member states meet,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands — The International Criminal Court's member states open their annual meeting Monday while the court faces pushback over arrest warrants for Israeli officials, sexual harassment allegations against the court's chief prosecutor and a very empty docket. The Assembly of States Parties, which represents the ICC's 124 member countries, will convene its 23rd conference to elect committee members and approve the court's budget against a backdrop of unfavorable headlines. Last month, judges granted a request from the court's chief prosecutor Karim Khan to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas' military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the nearly 14-month war in Gaza. It marks the first time that a sitting leader of a major Western ally has been accused by the global court of justice. The decision has been denounced by critics of the court and given only milquetoast approval by many of its supporters, a stark contrast to the robust backing of an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin last year over war crimes in Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden called the warrants for Netanyahu and the former defense minister ""outrageous"" and vowed to stand with Israel. A year ago, Biden called the warrant for Putin ""justified"" and said the Russian president had committed war crimes. The U.S. is not an ICC member country. France said it would ""respect its obligations"" but would need to consider Netanyahu's possible immunities. When the warrant for Putin was announced, France said it would ""lend its support to the essential work"" of the court. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who currently holds the European Union's rotating presidency, accused the court of ""interfering in an ongoing conflict for political purposes"" and said his country wouldn't arrest Netanyahu. Hungary is an ICC member country. The ICC was established in 2002 as the world's permanent court of last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the most heinous atrocities — war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression. The court only becomes involved when nations are unable or unwilling to prosecute those crimes on their territory. To date, 124 countries have signed on to the Rome Statute, which created the institution. Those who have not include Israel, Russia and China. The ICC has no police force and relies on member states to execute arrest warrants. Member country Austria begrudgingly acknowledged it would arrest Netanyahu but called the warrants ""utterly incomprehensible,"" Italy called them ""wrong"" but said it would be obliged to arrest him. Germany said it would study the decision. Global security expert Janina Dill worried that such responses could undermine global justice efforts. ""It really has the potential to damage not just the court, but international law,"" she told The Associated Press. U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, whose Republican party will control both branches of Congress in January, called the court a ""dangerous joke"" and urged Congress to sanction its prosecutor. ""To any ally, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, if you try to help the ICC, we're going to sanction you,"" Graham said on Fox News. President-elect Donald Trump sanctioned the court's previous prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, with a travel ban and asset freeze for investigating American troops and intelligence officials in Afghanistan. Milena Sterio, an expert in international law at Cleveland State University, told the AP that sanctions could affect a number of people who contribute to the court's work, such as international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. Clooney advised the current prosecutor on his request for the warrants for Netanyahu and others. ""Sanctions are a huge burden,"" Sterio said. Clooney did not respond to a request for comment. Khan is up against internal pressures as well. In October, the AP reported the 54-year old British lawyer is facing allegations he tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her. Two co-workers in whom the woman confided reported the alleged misconduct in May to the court's independent watchdog, which says it interviewed the woman and ended its inquiry after five days when she opted against filing a formal complaint. Khan was never questioned. He has denied the claims. The Assembly of States Parties has announced it will launch an external probe into the allegations. It's not clear if the investigation will be addressed during the meeting. The court, which has long faced accusations of ineffectiveness, will have no trials pending after two conclude in December. While it has issued a number of arrest warrants in recent months, many high-profile suspects remain at large. Member states don't always act. Mongolia refused to arrest Putin when he visited in September. Sudan's former President Omar al-Bashir is wanted by the ICC over accusations related to the conflict in Darfur, but his country has refused to hand him over. Last week, Khan requested a warrant for the head of Myanmar's military regime, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, for attacks against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority. Judges have yet to decide on that request. ""It becomes very difficult to justify the court's existence,"" Sterio said.",NPR,Lean Left,845,"Lean Right  
The article presents a generally critical view of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and highlights dissenting voices from various states, especially those associated with Western powers like the U.S. and Hungary. The framing of the ICC's struggles, criticisms from U.S. politicians, and mentions of Biden's disapproval of the warrants suggest a nuanced view that leans towards a right-leaning perspective, particularly regarding U.S.-Israel relations. Nonetheless, it also acknowledges international justice efforts and presents expert opinions that temper the criticism, indicating a balance but favoring a slight right-leaning bias."
19,Jeff Bezos says he is ‘optimistic’ about a new Trump term and can help with cutting regulations,"NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said Wednesday he is “optimistic” about President-elect Donald Trump’s second term and expressed some excitement about potential regulatory cutbacks in the coming years. NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said Wednesday he is “optimistic” about President-elect Donald Trump’s second term and expressed some excitement about potential regulatory cutbacks in the coming years. “I’m actually very optimistic this time around,” Bezos said on stage during a wide-ranging interview at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit in New York. “He seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. If I can help do that, I’m going to help him.” “We do have too many regulations in this country,” Bezos added. The comments follow Bezos’ October decision to prohibit The Washington Post, which he owns, from endorsing a presidential candidate, a move that led to tens of thousands of people canceling their subscriptions and protests from journalists with a deep history at the newspaper. At the time, Bezos wrote in an op-ed in the newspaper saying editorial endorsements create a perception of bias at a time when many Americans don’t believe the media, and do nothing to tip the scales of an election. On Wednesday, he said he would try to talk Trump “out of the idea” that the press is the enemy. “You’ve probably grown in the last eight years,” he said to journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin. “He has, too. This is not the case. The press is not the enemy.” Trump had railed against Bezos and his companies, including Amazon and The Washington Post, during his first term. In 2019, Amazon argued in a court case that Trump’s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract. The Biden administration later pursued a contract with both Amazon and Microsoft. In another part of the interview, Bezos said he doesn’t expect Elon Musk, who has been tasked with cutting regulations in the upcoming Trump term, to use his power to hurt his business competitors.

384,Sen. Joni Ernst says vetting process will continue for defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth,"Sen. Joni Ernst declined Thursday to give her full support to former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for defense secretary, and said the vetting process needs to continue. Some Republican senators have already announced their support for Mr. Hegseth, but others have expressed concerns about multiple allegations he faces regarding sexual assault, infidelity and alcoholism, among others. “I think for a number of our senators, they want to make sure that any allegations have been cleared and that’s why we have to have a very thorough vetting,” Ms. Ernst, Iowa Republican, told Fox News host Bill Hemmer during an interview Thursday. “And that’s why I was very happy to sit down with Pete and have that conversation with him.” Ms. Ernst met with Mr. Hegseth on Capitol Hill Wednesday. In an X post after the meeting, she said the two had a “frank and thorough conversation.” On Fox she said they talked about “a number of those issues.” “The vetting will continue, I am certain, through the next month or so until we approach that hearing date,” she said. Mr. Hegseth has been meeting with senators since before Thanksgiving and will continue to have meetings with them. On Wednesday he said he wouldn’t be backing down from the position. “I’m doing this for the warfighters, not the warmongers,” he posted Wednesday on X with a picture of himself and others in military attire. “The Left is afraid of disrupters and change agents.

268,Contentious budget plans are wreaking political havoc across Europe,"The French government once again stands on the brink of collapse, after Prime Minister Michel Barnier refused to bend to demands from right and left parties to make further concessions on the country’s budget plans. He now faces a no-confidence vote on Wednesday afternoon, which he is nearly certain to lose. Meanwhile, the German government is already on track for a snap election early next year, with its own no-confidence vote set to take place in the next few weeks. Even in the U.K., Prime Minister Kier Starmer and Finance Minister Rachel Reeves are under pressure just five months into the job, with disputes mainly centered around — you guessed it — the budget. So why have national budgets suddenly become so contentious? In the euro zone, post-pandemic fiscal rules are putting pressure on even the most hawkish EU members. France, Italy and Greece have long been seen as budget rule breakers. However, now Germany, Austria and the Netherlands are also falling foul of the EU’s deficit rules that nations need to keep a 3% deficit ratio and a 60% debt ratio relative to their GDP. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, now judges a budget not just on its financial plans for the year ahead, but for the impact it has on the long-term trajectory of each country’s deficit. In Paris, Barnier’s gamble to try to push through his 60 billion euros ($63 billion) of tax hikes and spending cuts by activating article 49.3 of the French constitution looks set to make him the shortest-serving French PM since 1958. The political brinkmanship has driven French stocks lower, while pushing borrowing costs to highs not seen since the euro zone debt crisis of the last decade. Over in Berlin, Chancellor Olaf Scholz made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday, pledging an arms deal worth 650 million euros with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The move raised eyebrows back in Germany, as the government’s aid to Ukraine was central to the disagreements within the coalition. The collapse of this government could have longer term ramifications for Germany’s fiscal rules, with opposition leader Friedrich Merz saying he would consider reviewing the once-sacred borrowing rules. There is more budget-related damage across the English Channel, where business confidence has dropped to the lowest level since the Covid-19 pandemic, and manufacturing has slowed down sharply since Reeves unveiled her tax-raising plans. It seems that the ramifications of a perceived “bad budget” are causing political casualties in a way that Europe will need to come to terms with for the foreseeable future. Goldman Sachs has slashed its growth forecast for the euro zone to 0.8% from 1.1% for 2025, highlighting the risks posed by President-elect Donald Trump’s next term in office, but also citing “upward pressure on long-term bond yields from higher deficits,” as well as “negative confidence effects from elevated geopolitical risks.” Edmund Shing, the global chief investment officer at BNP Paribas Wealth Management, highlighted that stagnation and instability are miring Europe just as the U.S. is gaining post-electoral clarity, with Trump set to re-enter the White House next month. “That lack of political certainty at the core, at the heart of Europe, comes at probably the worst moment politically that it could come at,” he told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” earlier this week.",CNBC,Center,550,"Center  
The article presents a factual overview of political turmoil in Europe regarding budgetary issues without showing strong ideological leanings.

188,How President Biden came to the decision to pardon his son Hunter,"President Joe Biden and his family discussed whether to pardon Hunter Biden during their time together in Nantucket for Thanksgiving, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to ABC News Monday. Senior White House staff learned of the possibility of a pardon on Saturday evening. President Biden made his final decision on Sunday, the source said. Biden did not answer questions on the issue as he left late Sunday for a three-day trip to Africa. He also ignored shouted questions during a brief stop in Cabo Verde on Monday and when he arrived in Angola. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, peppered with questions about the pardon during a gaggle with reporters on Air Force One, said Biden ""wrestled"" with the decision and made it himself over the weekend. ""It wasn't an easy decision to make,"" Jean-Pierre said. She added that President Biden ultimately believed his son was ""singled out politically"" and they ""tried to break his son in order to break him."" First lady Jill Biden, while unveiling the White House's holiday theme on Monday alongside military families, took a brief question on the Hunter Biden pardon. ""Of course I support the pardon of my son,"" she said. Hunter Biden, the president's only surviving son, was convicted on federal gun-related charges in June and pleaded guilty to nine tax-related charges in September. Both cases carried the possibility of significant prison time and he was set to be sentenced in both later this month. President Biden had long said he would not pardon his son, including in an interview with ABC's David Muir as Hunter Biden's gun trial was underway this past summer. In his statement on Sunday evening, Biden contended his son was ""unfairly"" prosecuted after pressure from his political opponents. ""For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice -- and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further,"" President Biden said. Hunter Biden, his wife Melissa Cohen Biden and their son Beau, as well as Ashley Biden, spent Thanksgiving in Nantucket with President Biden and first lady Jill Biden. ""I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,"" the president added. Asked what changed between Biden's past insistence he would not pardon his son and his announcement Sunday, Jean-Pierre repeatedly referred to Biden's statement. ""He wrestled with it. He thought about it. And he believed, and what he saw, was that his son was singled out,"" she said. ""And so he made this decision and once he made the decision, which was this weekend, he decided to move forward with it, and not to not to wait and. And you know, I think he truly believed enough is enough."" Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump, pounced on the reversal. Congressional Republicans spent years investigating the Biden family, including Hunter Biden, over their business dealings. House Republicans released a report in August on their impeachment probe filled with allegations, many targeted toward Hunter Biden, but no recommendation of specific impeachment articles and no evidence of President Biden himself being directly involved in alleged improper activities. It's not clear whether Republicans will continue their probes after President Biden leaves office in January. Jean-Pierre told reporters on Monday that Biden ""didn't believe they would let up."" ""They would continue to go after his son. That's what he believed,"" Jean-Pierre said. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday criticized the pardon, which extends as far back as 2014.",ABC,Lean Left,623,"Lean Left  
The article presents a narrative that emphasizes President Biden's justification for pardoning his son Hunter, highlighting the perceived political motivations behind the prosecution. It features quotes from Biden and his officials that frame the pardon in a sympathetic light, suggesting it was a difficult but necessary decision influenced by political pressures. Additionally, the article critiques Republicans for their investigations into the Biden family, further indicating a bias towards defending the Biden family's actions while minimizing Republican perspectives."

What Trump’s economic picks could foretell for second administrationUnmuteLoading Ad 00:00/01:21 LIVE Russia’s top general called chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Charles Q Brown Jr. last week as both countries grapple with a changing war in Ukraine. Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the architect of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, spoke with Brown about how to manage escalation concerns between the two countries. Russia recently launched a new intermediate-range ballistic missile into Ukraine that has nuclear capabilities. Russian leader Vladimir Putin said the launch was in response to Ukraine’s usage of longer-range weapons supplied by the United States and the United Kingdom. It’s believed this was Gerasimov’s first call with Brown, at least since he was elevated to chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His first call with the top American general since the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, spoke with him in October 2022, the year of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown, Jr., spoke with Chief of Russian General Staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov by phone on Nov. 27 following a request by the Russian Ministry of Defense,” Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Navy Capt. Jereal Dorsey told the Washington Examiner. “This was the first time the leaders spoke since Gen. Brown became chairman,” he added. “The leaders discussed a number of global and regional security issues to include the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. At the request of Gen. Gerasimov, Gen. Brown agreed to not proactively announce the call.” In the call, Gerasimov told Brown that Russia planned to use its Oreshnik ballistic missile well before the Biden administration had authorized Ukraine to use American Army Tactical Missile Systems to hit targets deeper into Russia. The Oreshnick missile struck a weapons facility in Dnipro, Ukraine. Putin previously justified the missile launch because the United States had allowed Ukraine to use longer-range missiles. “The regional conflict in Ukraine, previously provoked by the West, has acquired elements of a global character,” Putin said. “We are developing intermediate- and shorter-range missiles as a response to U.S. plans to produce and deploy intermediate- and shorter-range missiles in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.” As the conflict in Ukraine takes a turn, the Biden administration has continued its support for the country in its war against Russia. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Monday that the United States would provide Ukraine with an additional $725 million in military weapons. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER It’s unknown if President-elect Donald Trump will continue such support, but it’s unlikely that he’ll be as friendly to Ukraine as Biden has been. According to Reuters, Trump advisers have been floating several proposals to end the Ukraine war that would force the country to cede territory to Russia. Their aim would be to force both countries to the negotiating table with threats to boost aid to Ukraine or cede it if the country is unwilling to cooperate.",WashingtonExaminer,Lean Right,723,"Lean Right  
The article presents a narrative that appears to align with a Conservative viewpoint, referencing the current Biden administration's military support for Ukraine while also hinting at skepticism regarding Trump's potential policies towards the war.

303,"Mike Bloomberg warns making RFK Jr. HHS secretary risks killing Americans, urges Senate to reject him","Billionaire and public health advocate Mike Bloomberg on Tuesday excoriated Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. health secretary, over his anti-vaccine record and urged the Senate to reject his bid to lead the nation’s top health agencies. “Just imagine if RFK Jr. had been in office during Trump’s first term,” Bloomberg said at the Bloomberg American Health Summit in Washington D.C. “Would Operation Warp Speed have even happened? And if it did, how long would the vaccines have been delayed? How many fewer people would have gotten the shot? How many more people would have died?” “All we can say for sure is this: It would have made Covid even more deadly and even more economically painful,” he said. Giving RFK Jr. the power to steer U.S. health policy, he warned, would be “beyond dangerous, it would be medical malpractice on a mass scale.” The former New York City mayor devoted nearly all of his 19-minute speech to slamming Kennedy’s spread of disinformation about vaccines, including his “outrageous false claim” that the Covid-19 vaccine was the “deadliest vaccine ever made.” Bloomberg, who ran for president as a Democrat in 2020, has long advocated for public health reforms, both as mayor and through his philanthropic efforts. RFK Jr. initially ran for president in 2024 as a Democrat, but switched to an independent bid and later dropped out to endorse Trump. An environmental lawyer and the son of former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, RFK Jr.’s campaign provided him with a prominent national platform and gave oxygen to his conspiracy theories about vaccines. Bloomberg in Tuesday’s speech appealed directly to U.S. senators not to confirm RFK Jr. to the Cabinet role in the next Trump administration. “We can’t allow Kennedy or Trump or anyone else to bring unimaginable suffering to the American people,” he said. Bloomberg expressed hope that Senate Republicans will convince Trump to reconsider nominating RFK Jr. before they are asked to weigh in. But if Trump stands by his choice, then the Senate “has a duty for our whole country, but especially to our children, to vote no,” he said. Bloomberg also admonished Democrats who appear open to letting RFK Jr. lead the Department of Health and Human Services because of his advocacy against junk food and processed foods. “We don’t need to choose between someone who is pro-healthy food and pro-vaccine. Americans deserve both,” he said. Bloomberg noted that he had fought for numerous restrictions on unhealthy products while he was mayor, including an effort to ban large sugary drinks. Those fights garnered backlash from conservatives and affected consumer industries at the time. But RFK Jr. has taken a similar tack, endorsing a plan that he says is intended to “Make America Healthy Again” alongside Republicans. Bloomberg credited his own efforts with raising New Yorkers’ life expectancy, and touted the investments his philanthropic foundation continues to make to combat ailments like diabetes and heart disease. “But if the federal government steps back from vaccines, all of that progress will vanish,” he said, suggesting that doing so could result in millions of needless deaths. And if the government starts to invest in “nutty conspiracy theories,” then funding for researching cures for other diseases could be set back by years, Bloomberg argued. “It boggles the mind that the Senate would even consider giving Kennedy any power whatsoever over American health policy,” he said. “Whatever one may think of his positions on food policies, it’s nowhere near enough to overcome his opposition to vaccines.”",CNBC,Center,588,"Lean Left  
The article presents a critical perspective on Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his anti-vaccine stance, portraying him as dangerous to public health. Mike Bloomberg, a Democratic figure, is positioned as a proponent of vaccines and public health reforms, which reflects a preference for liberal policies. The language used, such as ""medical malpractice on a mass scale,"" indicates a strong opposition to conservative viewpoints that align with RFK Jr. This framing indicates a slight bias towards a left-leaning viewpoint in the context of public health and policy."
30,Takeaways from the Supreme Court arguments on transgender health care ban: Conservatives skeptical,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court heard the most high-profile case of its term on Wednesday, weighing Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming health care for transgender minors. Similar laws have been passed by other conservative-leaning states. Challengers say they deprive kids of treatment they need, while the states defend them as protecting minors from life-changing decisions. The conservative-majority court appeared ready to uphold Tennessee’s law. It comes against the backdrop of escalating pushback to transgender rights, notably from President-elect Donald Trump. Here are some takeaways from the arguments: In the arguments on Wednesday, five of the court’s six conservatives seemed skeptical of the argument that the ban on gender-affirming care for minors is discriminatory. Two key conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, repeatedly challenged the arguments from lawyers challenging the ban. Roberts questioned whether judges should be weighing in on a question of regulating medical procedures, an area usually left to state lawmakers. Barrett sounded skeptical of the administration’s argument that the law discriminates because of sex. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch was notably silent, asking no questions. The court’s other three conservatives seemed to favor Tennessee. The three liberals largely backed the challengers, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor highlighting the risks of suicide among kids with gender dysphoria. The litigation marked only the second time the high court has heard a case that represented a fundamental test of transgender rights. In a case involving LGBTQ+ rights four years ago, two conservative justices, Roberts and Gorsuch, joined with its liberals to expand protections for transgender workers. Barrett wasn’t on the bench at the time and had no record on transgender rights. Gorsuch wrote the opinion, which left open claims of discrimination in other situations. The court isn’t expected to rule for several months. The decision could have direct effects in the 26 states that have passed versions of the bans, and might have ripple effects on other measures that restrict sports participation and bathroom use by transgender people. Supporters of the health care laws argue the gender-affirming treatments are risky, and the laws protect kids from making decisions before they’re ready. Challengers say many medical interventions come with some degree of risk, and families should be able to weigh those against the benefits. The arguments in favor of Tennessee’s ban could also be used to back federal restrictions, said Chase Strangio, the ACLU attorney who represented three families challenging the law. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said that his state’s arguments would still let each state set its own policy.",APNEWS,Left,421,"Lean Left  
This article presents a critical view of conservative judicial perspectives on transgender healthcare bans, highlighting the skepticism of conservative justices towards arguments against such bans. It emphasizes the risks associated with denying gender-affirming care for minors and includes voices from liberal justices in support of transgender rights, indicating a lean toward a progressive stance on this issue. The discussion of potential harm and discrimination reinforces a viewpoint that favors the protection of transgender individuals, suggesting a Lean Left bias."
62,Revealed: Biden lays groundwork to expand immigration jails as Trump readies for office,"Donald Trump’s plan for the mass deportation of undocumented people and a related expansion of US detention facilities is getting an unexpected head start from Joe Biden – and private prison companies are already cashing in. The Biden administration has, for the past year, been in the process of extending contracts for private sector immigration jails across the US and exploring options for expanding detention capacity, a Guardian investigation has found. This is despite both the US president’s previous statements opposing such private jails and the fact that many facilities have a reputation for inhumane conditions. For this story, the Guardian reviewed hundreds of pages of contracting documents, government statements, inspection reports and private prison contractor calls with investors. The investigation reveals that during this final year of Biden’s presidency, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) federal agency has been working on extending at least 14 contracts with private prison companies to run a number of immigration detention centers across the country, against significant opposition from Democrats and advocates. All those facilities have fallen under intense scrutiny by, variously, federal government watchdogs, the US Senate and advocates, examining allegations of troubling and dangerous detention conditions. But the White House has resisted protests from congressional Democrats and campaign groups about the scale and standard of detention. “The Biden administration has increased the number of people in detention, doubled down on anti-immigrant, Trump-era deterrence policies, and expanded detention capacity in direct conflict with its own promises to end for-profit incarceration and bring fairness to the immigration system,” said Silky Shah, executive director of Detention Watch Network, a national advocacy working with detained immigrants. Instead of reassuring and preemptively protecting many terrified families and workers among the 11 million undocumented people in the US, the Biden administration has been working on contracts for more detention beds. These plans may not all get finalized, but private prison companies are enthusiastic about expansion opportunities now, as well as next year. “Let us be clear: Trump’s return to the White House, and his unprecedented mass deportation and immigration detention agenda will be catastrophic for all Americans,” Shah said. Families face being split up and communities turned upside down, she said. That’s apart from huge cost and economic production implications. “Biden now has a last chance to take decisive action to prevent catastrophe for millions of people and avoid handing the keys to an expanded and inhumane detention and deportation system to the next administration,” she added. There are no signs of such action so far in Biden’s waning weeks. Private prison contracts are negotiated by the number of “beds” in a facility. Documents reviewed by the Guardian show that Ice is in talks to add bed space in many locations, including in New Jersey, the midwest and several west coast cities that would add capacity to detain a total of at least 4,850 more people, amid plans to create new facilities or expand existing ones. That’s in addition to the almost 39,000 people currently held in federal immigration custody. Biden’s push is already “the greatest level of procurement activity we’ve seen with Ice in over a decade, demonstrating the continued need for additional detention solutions in various locations throughout the US”, Damon Hininger, the president and CEO of private contractor CoreCivic, said during a post-election call with investors. CoreCivic and GEO Group, the two biggest private prison contractors, reckon that the incoming Trump administration will be a further boon for their businesses and they are ready to assist the Republican president-elect’s mission to deport millions. People will probably be detained for a period between being arrested and expelled, as legal and logistical processes play out. “This is, to us, an unprecedented opportunity to assist the federal government and the incoming Trump administration toward achieving a much more aggressive immigration policy with regard to interior enforcement and border enforcement, and the removal of criminal aliens predominantly from this country,” said Brian Evans, the CEO of GEO Group, during a call with investors after Trump’s victory. The White House and Ice did not respond to requests for comment before publication. The private prison contractors GEO Group, LaSalle Corrections, Akima and Abyon LLC did not respond to requests for comment before publication. CoreCivic sent a statement. “CoreCivic is committed to providing safe, humane and appropriate care for the people in our facilities,” a CoreCivic spokesperson said. “Our facilities adhere to all Ice standards and are monitored by Ice officials every day. Our facilities are also audited regularly and without notice several times a year, and they are routinely visited by elected officials, attorneys, families and volunteers.” In mid-November, nearly 200 organizations wrote a letter to Biden and to the homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, urging them to close detention centers and halt expansion efforts before Trump takes office. “Facilities across the system have documented instances of physical abuse, inadequate food and water, negligent or abusive medical care, unsanitary conditions, failed plumbing and more. Avoidable deaths in Ice detention centers are at record numbers,” the letter said. During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden promised a significant shift from Trump’s first term hardline immigration policies, including promising an end to privately run detention centers. “No business should profit from the suffering of desperate people fleeing violence,” Biden had said. But four years on, the administration continues the rightward turn away from its 2020 promises and some early actions. Especially in the run-up to the 2024 elections, with immigration a central issue and a crackdown on asylum, Ice leaned in to expanding immigration detention. The 110 Ice facilities throughout the country typically detain undocumented people going through deportation proceedings as well as recently-arrived asylum seekers fighting their case to stay in the US but whom the government has barred from release while awaiting court dates. Although immigration detention is a civil not criminal system, conditions inside Ice detention centers are often indistinguishable from jails and prisons. Some are, indeed, former jails and prisons run by for-profit companies on government contracts. Texas has the most Ice detainees, followed by Louisiana, then California. Contract documents show that the Biden administration aims to add detention beds in Phoenix, Arizona, El Paso, Texas, Seattle and San Francisco, as well as other locations, and that Ice is now reviewing companies’ bids. “It is deeply concerning that Ice would expand private detention facilities now – just months before the inauguration of a president-elect who has promised to terrorize immigrant communities by detaining and deporting millions of people,” the senator Cory Booker said in a statement to the Guardian. He added: “I will continue to fight to ensure that detained immigrants are treated with dignity and that we value the wellbeing of immigrant communities in New Jersey above the share price of for-profit detention corporations.” Earlier this month Trump confirmed he would use the military to assist in mass deportations and his adviser Stephen Miller said military funds would be used to create new “vast holding facilities” to process people for deportation. Meanwhile, Biden has not backed away from his tougher stance. “It’s really just a step backwards,” said Esmeralda Santos, a lead organizer with the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, a group helping migrants in detention, adding: “We’re seeing Biden replicate some of the policies Trump was interested in and it’s really discouraging to see that. I thought we could have more faith in Biden. He let us down, honestly.” In September, a federal watchdog report on 17 unannounced inspections at Ice detention facilities, spread across the country, found many horrible conditions.

The article discusses the Biden administration's expansion of immigration detention facilities, contrasting it with his previous commitments to limit such practices. The critical tone towards Biden’s actions, especially when analyzed alongside the more hardline approaches of Trump, reflects a left-leaning bias.

167,"Justice Gorsuch will sit out a pending environmental case, citing ethics code","WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch will not participate in an environmental case being argued next week after having reviewed the court's new ethics code, according to a letter sent Wednesday to lawyers involved. The letter from Supreme Court Clerk Scott Harris did not explain why Gorsuch was recusing himself, saying only that ""consistent with the code of conduct"" he had decided not to participate. Liberal groups and more than a dozen members of Congress had urged him to recuse himself over his previous links to billionaire Philip Anschutz. Focus on Supreme Court justices and the rules that govern whether they recuse themselves from cases have drawn scrutiny in recent years, spurred largely by revelations about Justice Clarence Thomas’ ties to billionaire Harlan Crow. Justices have resisted codifying rules, but last year they adopted a new code of conduct that critics say lacks an enforcement mechanism. The case Gorsuch opted to sit out revolves around the environmental review process for a railroad in Utah that would ship crude oil out of the Uinta Basin to existing railroads. Anschutz has an interest in the project, as shown by an amicus brief Anschutz Exploration Corp. filed in the case backing it. In a letter last month, Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., wrote on behalf of himself and colleagues that Gorsuch has ""a serious and obvious conflict of interest that demands your recusal."" He mentioned that Gorsuch, before he became a judge, had represented Anschutz and his businesses and had close ties to him. As an appeals court judge before he was appointed to the Supreme Court, Gorsuch usually stepped aside from cases involving Anschutz. ""I applaud Justice Gorsuch for doing the right and honorable thing,"" Johnson said in a statement. “It is important that the court show the public that it is not in the pocket of billionaire benefactors."" But he added that the court's ethics code should have an enforcement mechanism, which he has introduced legislation to address.",NBC,Lean Left,327,"Lean Left  
The article highlights concerns about potential bias within the Supreme Court due to historical ties of Justice Gorsuch to a billionaire and cites critical comments from liberal lawmakers. The emphasis on the need for ethical conduct and the mention of scrutiny surrounding justices, particularly those with affluent connections, reflects a leaning towards left-leaning viewpoints on judicial accountability and ethics. The positive remarks about Gorsuch's recusal by a Democratic representative further suggest an alignment with leftist perspectives on the matter."
377,"‘Like being on vacation’: Federal employees are abusing remote work, senator’s audit finds","Telework has become a bit of a feds-gone-wild situation under President Biden, according to a new Senate report that says government workers have been caught taking bubble baths, drinking and driving or getting medical treatment — all while they were supposed to be on the clock. Just 6% of federal workers are showing up in person for a full day’s work every day, according to Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican who has been studying the issue. Meanwhile, one-third are remote employees, and they’re often soaking colleagues and taxpayers with their on-the-job antics. One Social Security employee ran his side business while he was supposed to be doing telework. Ms. Ernst said that employee had his mother and his wife access his Social Security computer system to record time on duty and cover for the fact he was running his business. In a now-famous case, a Veterans Affairs worker logged in for a meeting from a bubble bath. And a Housing and Urban Development employee drank and drove during the workday and got paid for the time she spent in an Oklahoma jail, Ms. Ernst said, citing a whistleblower. She said one Agriculture Department employee told her that colleagues saw working from home as “like being on vacation.” “Very little work was assigned, and all they had to do was be available by phone,” that food inspection service employee said. The no-shows have emptied out federal buildings, leaving the government to ponder what to do with the vacant offices. However, agencies are reluctant to give up their space. Officials justify their decisions by saying they want to be prepared in case the workers come back, but government investigators said the agencies are often just as worried about losing prestige if they give up real estate. Ms. Ernst said the generous telework policies are in place even as Americans struggle to reach government employees. She pointed to reports from veterans who said their calls for mental health appointments went unanswered. One soldier who worked on Black Hawk helicopters for the Army spent years trying to schedule appointments. When he finally got a therapist, she “spent the appointment singing the praises of remote work with her cat draped around her neck,” the senator reported. She also said she’s heard complaints about Iowa constituents who couldn’t get Social Security on the phone — even as the agency’s commissioner told her that Iowans were getting some of the best service in the country. “I shudder to think what may be happening elsewhere,” Ms. Ernst said in her report. She said there’s even become a perverse arms race among agencies to offer the best remote work policies. Social Security said it was struggling to compete with the Veterans Affairs Department, which was recruiting away employees by offering better telework opportunities. “While teleworking may be allowing VA employees to live their best lives, it’s a disservice to the vets the department exists to serve,” Ms. Ernst said. Her report comes as the incoming Trump administration looks for places to trim the budget. President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to run the Department of Government Efficiency to power through reforms. Ms. Ernst is leading a Senate caucus aimed at cooperating with that new agency. Mr. Musk took to X, his social media platform, to highlight Ms. Ernst’s finding that just 6% of employees show up full-time every day. “If you exclude security guards & maintenance personnel, the number of government workers who show up in person and do 40 hours of work a week is closer to 1%” he said. Ms. Ernst said savings can be had if the government looks for them. Even as offices are left empty, the government continues to buy furniture, at about a billion dollars a year, according to OpenTheBooks.com, a watchdog. Ms. Ernst said the government needs to rethink its approach, including a use-it-or-lose-it attitude toward real estate. She also called on agencies to forgo the blanket telework agreements they’ve pursued and require case-by-case determinations, with oversight and follow-up to make sure work is getting done. The senator said bright signs do exist, with a recent sale of a federal building in Orange County, California. But she said that’s rare. When the General Services Administration put the building up for sale with historic preservation restrictions, it got no takers on the $70 million price. Ms. Ernst said the lesson for the government is to quit tying things up in red tape.",WashingtonTimes,Lean Right,744,"Lean Right

60,Why Trump and the Federal Reserve could clash in the coming years,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on the promise that his policies would reduce high borrowing costs and lighten the financial burden on American households. WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on the promise that his policies would reduce high borrowing costs and lighten the financial burden on American households. But what if, as many economists expect, interest rates remain elevated, well above their pre-pandemic lows? Trump could point a finger at the Federal Reserve, and in particular at its chair, Jerome Powell, whom Trump himself nominated to lead the Fed. During his first term, Trump repeatedly and publicly ridiculed the Powell Fed, complaining that it kept interest rates too high. Trump’s attacks on the Fed raised widespread concern about political interference in the Fed’s policymaking. On Wednesday, Powell emphasized the importance of the Fed’s independence: “That gives us the ability to make decisions for the benefit of all Americans at all times, not for any particular political party or political outcome.” Political clashes might be inevitable in the next four years. Trump’s proposals to cut taxes and impose steep and widespread tariffs are a recipe for high inflation in an economy operating at close to full capacity. And if inflation were to reaccelerate, the Fed would need to keep interest rates high. Because Powell won’t necessarily cut rates as much as Trump will want. And even if Powell reduces the Fed’s benchmark rate, Trump’s own policies could keep other borrowing costs — like mortgage rates — elevated. The sharply higher tariffs that Trump has vowed to impose could worsen inflation. And if tax cuts on things like tips and overtime pay — another Trump promise — quickened economic growth, that, too, could fan inflationary pressures. The Fed would likely respond by slowing or stopping its rate cuts, thereby thwarting Trump’s promises of lower borrowing rates. The central bank might even raise rates if inflation worsened. “The risk of conflict between the Trump administration and the Fed is very high,” Olivier Blanchard, former top economist at the International Monetary Fund, said recently. If the Fed hikes rates, “it will stand in the way of what the Trump administration wants.” Yes, but with the economy sturdier than expected, the Fed’s policymakers may cut rates only a few more times — fewer than had been anticipated just a month or two ago. And those rate cuts might not reduce borrowing costs for consumers and businesses very much. The Fed’s key short-term rate can influence rates for credit cards, small businesses and some other loans. But it has no direct control over longer-term interest rates. These include the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects mortgage rates. The 10-year Treasury yield is shaped by investors’ expectations of future inflation, economic growth and interest rates as well as by supply and demand for Treasuries. An example occurred this year. The 10-year yield fell in late summer in anticipation of a Fed rate cut. Yet once the first rate cut occurred on Sept. 18, longer term rates didn’t fall. Instead, they began to rise again, partly in anticipation of faster economic growth. Trump has also proposed a variety of tax cuts that could swell the deficit. Rates on Treasury securities might then have to rise to attract enough investors to buy the new debt. “I honestly don’t think the Fed has a lot of control over the 10-year rate, which is probably the most important for mortgages,” said Kent Smetters, an economist and faculty director at the Penn Wharton Budget Model. “Deficits are going to play a much bigger role in that regard.” Occasional or rare criticism of the Fed chair isn’t necessarily a problem for the economy, so long as the central bank continues to set policy as it sees fit. But persistent attacks would tend to undermine the Fed’s political independence, which is critically important to keeping inflation in check. To fight inflation, a central bank often must take steps that can be highly unpopular, notably by raising interest rates to slow borrowing and spending. Political leaders have typically wanted central banks to do the opposite: Keep rates low to support the economy and the job market, especially before an election. Research has found that countries with independent central banks generally enjoy lower inflation. Even if Trump doesn’t technically force the Fed to do anything, his persistent criticism could still cause problems. If markets, economists and business leaders no longer think the Fed is operating independently and instead is being pushed around by the president, they’ll lose confidence in the Fed’s ability to control inflation. And once consumers and businesses anticipate higher inflation, they usually act in ways that fuel higher prices — accelerating their purchases, for example, before prices rise further, or raising their own prices if they expect their expenses to increase. “The markets need to feel confident that the Fed is responding to the data, not to political pressure,” said Scott Alvarez, a former general counsel at the Fed. He can try, but it would likely lead to a prolonged legal battle that could even end up at the Supreme Court. At a November news conference, Powell made clear that he believes the president doesn’t have legal authority to do so. Most experts think Powell would prevail in the courts. And from the Trump administration’s perspective, such a fight might not be worth it. Powell’s term ends in May 2026, when the White House could nominate a new chair. It is also likely that the stock market would tumble if Trump attempted such a brazen move. Bond yields would probably rise, too, sending mortgage rates and other borrowing costs up. Financial markets might also react negatively if Trump is seen as appointing a loyalist as Fed chair to replace Powell in 2026. Yes, and in the most egregious cases, it led to stubbornly high inflation. Notably, President Richard Nixon pressured Fed Chair Arthur Burns to reduce interest rates in 1971, as Nixon sought re-election next year, which the Fed did. Economists blame Burns’ failure to keep rates sufficiently high for contributing to the entrenched inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s. Thomas Drechsel, an economist at the University of Maryland, said that when presidents intrude on the Fed’s interest rate decisions, “it increases prices quite consistently and it increases expectations, and ... that worries me because that means inflation might become quite entrenched.” Since the mid-1980s, with the exception of Trump in his first term, presidents have scrupulously refrained from public criticism of the Fed. “It’s amazing, how little manipulation for partisan ends we have seen of that policymaking apparatus,” said Peter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “It really is a triumph of American governance.” Yes, most advanced economies do. But in some recent cases, as in Turkey and South Africa, governments have sought to dictate interest-rate policy to the central bank. And soaring inflation has typically followed. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for years pressured the country’s central bank to cut interest rates even as prices spiked. He even fired three central bankers who had refused to comply. In response, inflation skyrocketed to 72% in 2022, according to official measures. Last year, Erdogan finally reversed course and allowed the central bank to raise rates.",APNEWS,Left,1216,"Center

8,'I've seen tougher guys at Starbucks': MAGA country star turns on Republican senator,"One-half of the country duo Big & Rich laid into Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Wednesday evening over the senator's comments about Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's embattled pick for Pentagon chief. John Rich, a vocal supporter of Trump — and vehement opponent of Joe Biden who once mocked the president as ""Sniffy"" over his sniffles — took to the social media site X to voice his displeasure with Republicans waffling on Hegseth's nomination. ""The pro-war RINO's are all against @PeteHegseth and that tells you all you need to know,"" wrote Rich. ""Pete is a threat to the war machine. Recess appointments?"" He added in a separate post, ""Don't Kavanaugh our Hegseth,"" referring to the tough confirmation hearing of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose nomination was dogged by a sexual assault allegation and protests. Rich then set his sights on Graham, who has called the allegations against Hegseth ""disturbing."" ""I think some of these articles are very disturbing. He obviously has a chance to defend himself here, but some of this stuff is it's going to be difficult..."" Graham told CBS News. Rich unleashed a series of posts on X targeting Graham, including at least two that used a homophobic reference. ""Who do you trust more? (repost for maximum results and hilarious responses:)"" Rich asked his followers, providing just two responses: Santa Claus and Lindsey Graham. ""I sat across from Lindsey Graham at dinner with DJT a while back.

I gave him a look that would hairlip the devil, then dismantled him,"" Rich later posted. He added: ""I've seen tougher guys at Starbucks."" Rich didn't stop there. He shared Graham's office number to his followers and urged them to let him know their feelings about confirming Hegseth.

206,Does the secretary of education need to be an educator?,"While Linda McMahon, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for education secretary, is meeting with senators who will determine whether she'll be confirmed for that role, her lack of experience in schools is being debated. The former World Wrestling Entertainment co-founder and president could earn a second stint in a Trump Cabinet if confirmed to run the Department of Education next year. While McMahon has experience running a large government organization -- she led the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019 in Trump's first term -- she has not worked in education outside of stints on the board of trustees at Sacred Heart University and serving on the Connecticut state Board of Education more than a decade ago. According to Trump's Agenda47 policy platform, Trump's top education priorities include eliminating the agency that McMahon would lead and topics that she has championed, like expanding school voucher programs and restoring power to parents in schools. McMahon allies suggest the businesswoman and Trump loyalist will disrupt and reshape the federal agency that's been led by Washington bureaucrats for more than four decades. McMahon met Tuesday with Oklahoma Republican Markwayne Mullin, a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, who predicted Wednesday, ""I think she's going to get through pretty easy."" Asked if he had talked about dismantling the Education Department, Mullin said that he wouldn't discuss the details of their meeting. On the House side, GOP Rep. Virginia Foxx, chairwoman of the Education and the Workforce Committee, called McMahon a fighter who will work tirelessly for students. And Foxx's colleague on the committee, Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., celebrated McMahon's atypical history. ""We've all been educated and some of us know more than these egghead educators,"" Walberg said. ""Certainly [the] bureaucrats who aren't even willing to come into the office now. I don't hold any trust in them."" After being nominated, McMahon defended her record in a post on X. ""I've witnessed the transformative power of education, both in the classroom and also in apprenticeship programs,"" McMahon wrote, adding, ""All students should be equipped with the necessary skills to prepare them for a successful future."" Trump's nominees this cycle have stirred controversy, including defense secretary nominee and former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, Health and Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who removed himself from consideration for attorney general after just eight days due to being a distraction to the Trump/Vance transition. The president-elect's pick to run the Department of Education in his first term, billionaire Betsy DeVos, had no qualifications in the education field. It took then-Vice President Mike Pence's tie-breaking vote to confirm her in 2017. Tiffany Justice, co-founder of the conservative parental rights organization Moms for Liberty, argued the president-elect doesn't need an educator to lead the department so long as parents' rights are on the agenda. ""I think he [Trump] needs to have someone who's unapologetically America-first and who's going to put the power back to people and when it comes to the education of children, that's parents,"" Justice told ABC News, adding, ""I think leading with parental rights is probably the most important thing that he can do."" Walberg told ABC News he believes McMahon will be a tough secretary who will carry out Trump's goal of closing the department. Democratic lawmakers on the House education committee were less thrilled with the selection but not completely opposed to McMahon. ""It seems that there were others that probably could have added more from the perspective of background in education, but we'll see,"" ranking member Bobby Scott, D-Va., said. Scott commended McMahon's support for the Bipartisan Workforce Pell Act, which is a bill he co-sponsored that uses short-term Pell grants to align education opportunities with workforce needs. He also acknowledged that teaching in the classroom is not a requirement for holding the top education office. ""Someone good in education policy doesn't necessarily have to be someone who was a teacher, but, you know, somebody who's got some ideas on policy and how to improve access to college, improve academic achievement, how to eliminate the achievement gap, graduation rates -- I mean the kind of things that we're trying to achieve,"" Scott said. Education experts suggest shuttering the department could gut public education funding and disproportionately impact high-need students across the country. Reps. Scott and Jahana Hayes, D-Conn., are both opponents of Trump's longstanding pledge to dismantle the department. Hayes, the 2016 National Teacher of the Year, taught in Connecticut when McMahon was on the board of education. Hayes said she is squarely focused on defending public schools. ""I'll just wait for the nomination process,"" Hayes told ABC News, adding ""I believe deeply in public education and I'll always advocate not only for students but for the profession, and I think we need people that care as deeply about that as I do."" But allegations against McMahon and her husband Vince McMahon have clouded the nomination. A recent lawsuit alleges the couple concealed years of sexual abuse of minors who worked as the WWE's ringside crew. Under Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in education programs, McMahon and the department would be responsible for investigating sexual misconduct complaints in schools. Linda McMahon's attorney Laura Brevetti said the alleged scandal was investigated by the FBI, which found no grounds to continue the investigation at the time, and called the recent lawsuit ""baseless."" Meanwhile, Wil Del Pilar, senior vice president of the advocacy group The Education Trust, labeled the McMahon pick as a ""slap in the face"" particularly to conservative educators who are more deserving of the job.",ABC,Lean Left,936,"Center

Possible names include current and former officials such as retired Gen. Mark Milley, former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, Sen.-elect Adam Schiff and Dr. Anthony Fauci. Politico was first to report the news. The consideration comes after Biden issued a full pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, on Dec. 1. The move sparked backlash from Republicans and criticism from many Democrats. The White House said Biden did so, despite his past pledges not to pardon his son, because ""it didn't seem his political opponents would let go of it."" Throughout his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump vowed to exact ""retribution"" on his political enemies. Milley, who retired as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff last year, has long been a target of Republican attacks over the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. He also stoked Trump's ire over a report that Milley secretly called his Chinese counterpart before and after the 2020 election to dispel China's fears Trump was not planning an attack. Trump accused Milley of ""treason"" after the report. Cheney and Schiff have also long been criticized by Trump over their investigation into the attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob on Jan. 6, 2021. The two were part of the House Jan. 6 committee's yearlong probe, which concluded with the recommendation of criminal charges against Trump. Schiff also was the lead House prosecutor in Trump's first Senate impeachment trial. Cheney lost her reelection bid in 2022 to a Trump-backed Republican challenger. Cheney endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump, and appeared with Harris several times on the campaign trail.

202,"GOP senators seek 'normal process' to confirm Trump nominees, torn over FBI background checks","As Republicans senators returned to Washington after Thanksgiving recess to a renewed peppering of questions about President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks, a familiar refrain emerged: trust the confirmation process. ""That's why we're going to take the normal process, vet all the nominees, and give everybody a chance to ask those questions during a hearing,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said when asked about new allegations concerning Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice for defense secretary. ""That is why our process is so important,"" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said when asked about the controversial reports surrounding Hegseth. ""The president is allowed to have his appointees who we will have to see,"" Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said when asked about Kash Patel, Trump's nominee to lead the FBI. ""I don't know Kash Patel, we have to have him go through the process."" ""Like all the other nominees, he'll get a process and a confirmation hearing and vetting and everything else. They'll all have to through it, and we'll see where the process takes us,"" incoming Senate Republican Leader John Thune said about Patel. The responses fell short of glowing endorsements for some of Trump's nominees. And even as many Republicans call for regular processes to be followed as these nominations are considered, there remains at least one discrepancy on what a normal order process would look like. The Trump transition team on Tuesday entered a memorandum of understanding with the Justice Department that allows it to submit names for FBI background checks, Trump's Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said, but the memo does not indicate that it will. ABC News has reached out to the transition team to see if it intends to submit all Cabinet nominees for background checks. Though vetting of nominations has traditionally included an FBI background check, Republican senators are torn on whether one is 100% necessary for confirmation. Thune told ABC News the issue over background checks will hopefully be ""resolved."" While noting that there are ""other alternatives"" for getting information, Thune said that FBI background checks are ""historically"" the best way. ""I think, hopefully at some point they'll get this background check issue resolved. At this point I'm not sure exactly how it's going to be resolved but I think they will. I think the administration understands there's got to be a thorough vetting of all of these noms,"" Thune said. ""And that, you know, historically, the best place to get that done has been through the FBI. They have other alternatives, you know, obviously, I assume our committee chairman will just want to make sure that they've got the background that they need to carefully evaluate these noms."" Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee that will be responsible for managing Hegseth's nomination, told ABC News the panel is ""looking at the way its been done traditionally and getting information about that as to who actually orders the FBI background check."" But when pushed on whether he would want to see an FBI background check, he said he would. ""I would prefer a full background check, yes,"" Wicker said. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said he believes there will be background checks and he'd like to see them. ""My preference would be an FBI background check, and I'm not, I don't know that we won't have FBI background checks. I know that we have really good staffs and really good investigators, and they work closely with the FBI, so I'm not worried at all about -- about not having background checks done on -- not just these nominees, but any nominees by a president. I think that’s a false issue,"" Kennedy said. Some senators kept their cards close on this issue. Cornyn ignored questions on whether he'd want to see a FBI background check for nominees like Patel. But others are prepared to follow Trump's lead. ""My position is what President Trump decides to do is what I will support,"" Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said. No Republican senator flatly rejected Patel as Trump's choice to lead the Department of Justice, though many said they'll wait for Patel to move through the Senate Judiciary Committee before making a decision on him. But ultimately, for Patel to be installed, current FBI Director Chris Wray would need to be fired or step down. There appears to be a general sense among Republicans that they would be okay with Wray being forced out. ""I am, I am,"" Capito said when asked if she would be comfortable with Trump removing Wray to install Patel. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said she likes Patel, and added that the FBI needs someone new to ""go in and clean it up."" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said it is reasonable for Trump to want to put in place someone he is comfortable with after his experiences during his first administration and in the years that followed.",ABC,Lean Left,811,"Lean Right  
The article primarily presents perspectives from Republican senators regarding the confirmation process of Trump’s nominees, showing a supportive stance towards Trump's decisions. While it does include caution and mentions of traditional vetting processes, the overall tone aligns with Republican viewpoints, suggesting a bias towards the right. The language used tends to underplay concerns about the nominees, reflecting a preference for maintaining party loyalty and the administration's objectives, which is typical of a lean right perspective in media coverage."
72,Police release new photo of suspect sought in killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO,"The New York police department on Thursday issued a fresh image clearly showing the face of a man they suspect of shooting and killing the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, early on Wednesday in Manhattan. The manhunt continued and police appeared to be closing in on the fugitive as key new clues surfaced. The newly-released images were taken by security cameras at a hostel on the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan where police think the suspect stayed. In previous images issued the suspect was wearing a mask. But late morning on Thursday, police posted photographs showing a young man smiling and one of the same person looking more serious, with the hood of his coat up. The suspect remained at large while investigators scrambled to find out his identity and as police continued to comb through a vast network of private and public surveillance cameras. Law enforcement deployed drones and dogs in addition to sifting through data related to electric bikes. Despite officials previously referring to the Citi Bike brand of public-use e-bike to talk about the vehicle that was used in the crime, and thousands of which are dotted around the city at charging ports, later on Thursday morning this proved to be unconfirmed. There was a report by the New York Times, citing sources familiar with the investigation, that police were now looking into it being an unmarked electric bike.Police chiefs have said it was a targeted killing. Among other clues discovered were acell phone, video footage of the suspect and shell casings from bullets found at the scene with the words “deny”, “defend” and “depose”, according to unnamed sources who also spoke with ABC News. Those words potentially evoke a book published 14 years ago that criticized the US health insurance industry, with its title using vocabulary common in corporate language around insurance claims, called Delay Deny Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don’t Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It, Reuters reported. The book’s author, Jay Feinman, a professor emeritus at Rutgers University Law School in New Jersey, told the news agency “sorry, no comment” in an email responding to an enquiry. The coincidence hints at possible motive, but by early Thursday afternoon the authorities had not addressed that angle nor posited a motive for the killing. Police had earlier searched the hostel where the suspect is believed to have stayed, CNN reported, also reporting that police found a fingerprint while investigating objects connected to the man, including a cellphone and a water bottle, and that evidence was being examined in hopes it could pin down an identity. “This does not appear to be a random act of violence,” Jessica Tisch, New York City police commissioner, told reporters. “Every indication is that this was a premeditated, pre-planned, targeted attack.” Thompson was killed by a man in black carrying a gray backpack and with his face covered up to the nose around 6.40am ET Wednesday. The police have been using the word “he” when referring to the suspect. The man in questions had leveled a handgun fitted with a silencer at Thompson’s back and shot the executive at least once in the back and the calf, just as he was about to enter a midtown Manhattan Hilton hotel for an annual investor conference. As Thompson collapsed on the sidewalk, the gun jammed, the man – “proficient” in firearms according to police – quickly cleared it and resumed shooting. The suspect then fled on an e-bike into nearby Central Park. As of Thursday, there have been no arrests in the case, and police offered a $10,000 reward for information. Since Wednesday, police have also uncovered footage of the man near the Frederick Douglass public housing project on Manhattan’s Upper West Side around 5am ET, ABC News reported. The suspect’s motives remain unknown. Thompson’s widow said her husband had received threats. However, such incidents are not uncommon in controversial sectors. “There had been some threats,” Paulette Thompson told NBC News. “Basically, I don’t know, a lack of coverage? I don’t know details. I just know that he said there were some people that had been threatening him.” UnitedHealthcare is a branch of UnitedHealth Group, one of the largest companies in the United States. The branch insures tens of millions of people with private health coverage. The need for private-sector health insurance is a fact of life in the US, but frequently a thorn in American’s side, and insurers are often accused of unfairly denying coverage. The company was also the subject of an insider trader investigation and inquiry into unfair trade practices, Fox Business News reported. Thompson’s killing quickly sent shockwaves through the corporate world, with corporate security heads gathering in a conference call to Wednesday. “Many of my colleagues today are sitting down with their executive protection team leaders, their security leadership teams, and re-evaluating what they are doing and not doing,” Dave Komendat, president of Seattle-based Komendat Risk Management Services told the New York Times. Another security executive, CEO Michael Julian of MPS Security & Protection, told Axios: “I’m just shocked the guy didn’t have a protective detail.” Thompson is survived by his wife Paulette and two sons.

251,Trump calls Florida meeting with Trudeau productive amid stiff tariff threat,"President-elect Donald Trump called his meeting with Justin Trudeau productive and said the prime minister made a commitment to work with the United States to end the drug crisis amid the threat of stiff tariffs. “We discussed many important topics that will require both Countries to work together to address, like the Fentanyl and Drug Crisis that has decimated so many lives as a result of Illegal Immigration, Fair Trade Deals that do not jeopardize American Workers, and the massive Trade Deficit the U.S. has with Canada,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social Saturday. Trudeau flew to Florida Friday evening to attend a dinner at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump’s transition team is based. The in-person meeting came at the end of a rocky week in which Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico unless the two countries stop illegal border crossings and prevent illicit drugs from entering the United States. Trudeau thanked Trump for the dinner in a post on social media on Saturday. “I look forward to the work we can do together, again,” Trudeau said in the post that included a picture of the two leaders sitting at a table and smiling together. Trump said he and Trudeau discussed the drug crisis and the president-elect made it “very clear that the United States will no longer sit idly by as our Citizens become victims” of the drug epidemic, which he attributed to cartels and fentanyl coming from China. “Prime Minister Trudeau has made a commitment to work with us to end this terrible devastation of U.S. Families,” Trump posted. Trump’s post did not directly mention tariffs, and it’s unclear whether the prime minister’s visit has alleviated his concerns about the border. A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said the leaders “shared a productive wide-ranging discussion” centered on collaboration and strengthening the bilateral relationship. “As Canada’s closest friend and ally, the United States is our key partner, and we are committed to working together in the interests of Canadians and Americans,” the statement said. Trudeau had a notably rocky relationship with the Republican leader during the first Trump administration. However, the prime minister was the first G-7 leader to visit Trump since the Nov. 5 election. Trudeau’s invitation to Mar-a-Lago says a lot about the working relationship, a senior government source said, speaking on background. The dinner lasted more than three hours. Sources said Trudeau and Trump discussed trade, border security, Ukraine, NATO, icebreakers, the Middle East and the Group of Seven meeting in Alberta next year. They also talked about energy projects, including the Keystone Pipeline, Line 5, Trans Mountain Pipeline, and other topics related to liquefied natural gas. It was described as a friendly and welcoming dinner. Trump’s social media post about the meeting with Trudeau appeared much more collaborative in tone than his response to a phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum earlier this week after which he claimed a tariff victory. Trump wrote Wednesday that Sheinbaum had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States, “effectively closing our Southern Border.” The Mexican president said that it was an “excellent” conversation but countered that her country was already doing its part. “We reiterate that Mexico’s position is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and between peoples,” Sheinbaum said. Trump’s return to the White House has brought concern to America’s closest neighbors. He has long used the threat of import taxes to pressure other countries to do his bidding, saying last summer that “the most beautiful word in the dictionary is ‘tariff.’” The Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement is up for review in 2026 and experts suspect this week’s tariff announcement is a negotiating tactic. Canadian premiers have been calling on Trudeau to be more proactive in his approach to the incoming Trump administration. More than 77% of Canadian exports go to the United States and provincial leaders have said Trump’s duties would be devastating. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he was glad Trudeau met Trump to learn more about the president-elect’s concerns. But Ottawa has to show the premiers a plan to make the border more secure to avoid “disastrous tariffs,” Ford said in a statement on social media. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said she believed Trump and Trudeau had a constructive conversation. Speaking on her provincewide call-in radio shown Saturday, Smith said it was notable the conversation included the energy sector. Canada is the largest source of U.S. energy imports, and almost all Canadian crude oil exports went to its neighbor in 2023. The Alberta premier said it’s critical to demonstrate how Canada’s energy aligns with America’s domestic and international interests. “Our strategy is this: let’s talk to the Americans about the things we know they need and use that as a leverage point to make sure that we have zero tariffs on all goods,” Smith said.",CNBC,Center,817,"Center

229,The Democrats who aren't writing off Elon Musk's DOGE,"As Republicans rush to embrace Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy's Department of Government Efficiency, most Democrats have taken a dismissive, even adversarial approach to the new initiative. ""Musk is a narcissist, a grifter, and a self-serving plutocrat,"" said Democratic Rep. Greg Casar of Texas. ""I don't have my hopes up that Elon Musk is going to do anything other than really awful, stupid, self-serving stuff."" It's not hard to see why. Ramaswamy was one of the more right-wing 2024 GOP presidential candidates, while Musk — who just spent an immense sum of his own money to get Donald Trump elected — has emerged in recent years as a Democratic bogeyman. And while the contours of DOGE's agenda remain vague, there are already signs that progressive priorities could fall victim to Musk and Ramaswamy's proposals for deep spending cuts. Yet a handful of Democratic lawmakers have signaled a willingness to engage, eyeing DOGE as an unlikely opportunity to push their own long-standing policy goals. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, see tackling wasteful military spending as a potential point of common cause with DOGE. Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Florida on Tuesday became the first Democrat to join the House's DOGE caucus. He told BI that his ""singular focus"" would be restructuring the Department of Homeland Security by making the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Secret Service report directly to the president. ""If this is where that conversation is going to happen, I'm happy to be at the table,"" Moskowitz said. ""And if they want to do stupid stuff, I'll call it out and I'll vote against it."" The three lawmakers' DOGE-curious posturing also offers an early look at how some Democrats, fresh off of a defeat in the 2024 election, plan to cautiously engage with a Trump administration that's set to pursue a more radical transformation of the country than the first time around. Khanna, a Silicon Valley-based progressive who remains cordial with Musk, appears to be taking the billionaire businessman seriously when he says he wants to examine the Pentagon's budget, citing Musk's past criticism of bloated defense contracts. The congressman has also suggested that Democrats have unduly alienated Musk in recent years. ""If Musk is going to help bring accountability to defense contractors, that's something that Democrats should welcome,"" Khanna said. But other progressives who want military spending cuts are much more suspicious. ""I highly doubt that one of the largest defense contractors in the United States — and by that I mean Elon Musk — is going to opt for the federal government to cut the money that he is receiving directly from them,"" said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. ""He relies on the federal government to give him money."" Sanders, who argued on X that Musk ""is right"" about bloated military spending, may be using the unexpected synergy to highlight an issue he's long cared about. The Vermont senator told BI that he hadn't directly engaged with Musk and that it remains to be seen how seriously the SpaceX founder should be taken on the issue. ""I would hope that he is serious,"" Sanders said. ""If you want to save taxpayer dollars, you do it not by cutting programs for hungry children but by getting rid of the waste and fraud in the military."" Despite these small areas of potential agreement, much of what Musk and Ramaswamy have floated so far is likely to be anathema to the average Democratic lawmaker. There's a reason that Republicans and not Democrats are set to meet with the duo at the Capitol on Thursday. Last week, Musk said that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency established by President Barack Obama that regulates financial services, should be eliminated. And Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota said Musk and Ramaswamy wanted to ""defund Planned Parenthood,"" as the duo described the organization as a recipient of ""federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended."" That's not deterring lawmakers like Khanna and Moskowitz just yet. ""Obviously, if they're targeting areas that are going to lead to less education funding or less consumer protection, we need to speak up passionately, vociferously, and oppose it,"" Khanna said. ""But our opposition will be much more effective and reasonable if we're willing to work with them on areas where there is government fraud and abuse."" ""Some of these recommendations, I'm sure, will be horrible,"" Moskowitz said. ""But a broken clock is right twice a day, so if there are things that they find that we can improve, shouldn't we give it a chance?"" But while Khanna could end up serving on a new DOGE subcommittee set to be chaired by Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Moskowitz says he's steering clear. ""I'm not interested in doing anything Marjorie Taylor Greene touches,"" Moskowitz said. ""She's not a serious member.""",BusinessInsider,Lean Left,824,"Lean Left  
The article presents a generally skeptical view of Elon Musk and the right-wing initiatives associated with him, amplifying criticisms from Democratic lawmakers. It discusses the challenges of bipartisan engagement while highlighting a few Democrats who show willingness to cooperate, reflecting a more progressive perspective. The emphasis on the adversarial tone towards Musk and the mention of Republican figures without support creates an overall Lean Left bias."
389,NY auto body students restoring Vietnam-era Huey helicopter whose pilot died  in 1968 Tet Offensive,"A group of auto body students in New York State are refurbishing a piece of American history as they work on a Vietnam-era helicopter whose pilot was killed in battle back in 1968. The class at Orleans BOCES Center in Medina, New York — about an hour east of Niagara Falls — teamed up with a local American Legion Post to restore the decommissioned UH-1 Iroquois “Huey” helicopter. But they have a certain vision for the legendary chopper, which began its long career in the American military in 1956 — and still serves to this day. 3 Students work on the UH-1 Huey, a famed piece of military machinery that’s been featured in films like “Apocalypse Now.” wkbw “It’s not about making it look brand new,” shop class teacher Jim Rozewski told ABC 7 Buffalo. “We want it to have the history that it’s deserved and you know, that it’s earned through its life.” This particular helicopter has a tragic history, however.

Sandefur of Tulsa, Oklahoma was piloting the helicopter when a bullet pierced it, killing him and forcing his co-pilot to land the bird. Scott Wymyczak, commander of American Legion Post 1253, told the station he’d learned about the doomed pilot when he researched the famed piece of military machinery’s history. And when the students are done with their work — which includes overhauling the lights so they can flash on and off — they’ll properly commemorate him. “We have his image — it’s going in the pilot’s window,” Wymyczak said, adding they’ve been in touch with the war hero’s niece and will also install a tribute on a piece of black granite. 3 The class at Orleans BOCES Center in Medina, New York, poses alongside representatives of American Legion 1253. facebook/onbocescte 3 The students will make a variety of repairs, including fixing the chopper’s decaying aluminum. wkbw Seeing the chopper again brought back memories for the Legion’s treasurer, Vietnam vet Cliff Grant. “That used to be a great sound to hear the choppers coming to pick you up from the field — you’d been out there a couple weeks,” he told the station. The students, meanwhile, are just excited about the living history lesson. They got their hands on the Huey back in October, and have been applying a clear coat with a satin finish that blacks out the windows, according to Facebook post from the Legion. The students will also repair the decaying aluminum. “This can actually benefit us by a lot — because then just by having this, imagine about the other things we can get in here, other great artifacts,” student Khalil Golden said as he taped up one of the windows. Xander Lotempio, another of the shop’s pupils, told the station the old Huey was “more intricate, and just a lot more than I expected.” And it’s good on-the-job training for Evan Quiros, who said he was “going into the military to work on just about the same stuff, for the most part.” Eventually, the chopper will be put on display at the new Veterans Memorial Park that’s being built near the Hartland Fire Company firehall, the station said.",NewYorkPost,Lean Right,593,"Center

343,How a French Whale Made $85 Million off Trump’s Win,"On October 15, three weeks before the presidential election, Ashley Grosse heard that a Frenchman wanted to run a study with the firm where she works, YouGov. In an email, the prospective client told the firm he wanted to poll “the current U.S. elections focused on three swing states, specifically Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin,” investigating the “shy voter effects” within the next seven days. “The faster, the better,” he wrote.Soon Grosse, the general manager for YouGov’s Scientific Research unit, found herself in a Zoom meeting with the Frenchman, where she agreed to conduct the polling he wanted. What she went on to discover with her poll led him to place the single largest bet ever made on an election. His wager was that Donald Trump would win—and win big.“I had conviction,” the high-rolling whale told me over the phone last week, “so I bet a lot of money.”That a trader living in Europe was able to predict such a decisive victory when every major professional pollster was forecasting a dead heat is one of the most surprising tales of the U.S. election. Now, the Frenchman is revealing to The Free Press exclusive details about how he did it.In our conversations by phone and email, I discovered he is a trader who wanted to go by the pseudonym “Théo,” because he said disclosing his identity “would disrupt my life, as my family and friends are not aware of the extent of my wealth. It will also seriously endanger my safety and that of my kids.”Back in October, Grosse—who knows Théo’s true identity—told him it was extremely difficult to gauge the preferences of so-called “shy voters,” who either can’t be reached or refuse to talk to pollsters. But Théo said he had an idea. He had seen some academic literature about “social circle polling,” in which pollsters asked people not only who they were voting for but who they thought their acquaintances were voting for. Those polls had performed well. He wanted Grosse’s team to do something similar: Ask people in the three swing states who they thought their neighbors were planning to vote for. Grosse later told me she found his idea “intellectually interesting,” but she was skeptical the neighbor question would unearth anything useful. But Théo was convinced it would smoke out a major preference for Trump over Kamala Harris that was hiding in plain sight. “It was clear to me that most of the polls were skewed to the advantage of Harris by. . . ignoring the shy Trump voter effect,” he wrote to me in an email.What Grosse didn’t know—what nobody knew at the time—was the reason he was commissioning the poll: He was placing multimillion-dollar bets with Polymarket, the popular prediction market. Even before engaging YouGov, he had wagered $30 million on Trump. Once he saw the results of the neighbor question at the end of October, he went all in, using 11 different crypto accounts to raise his stake to $80 million. In fact, he was so confident Trump would win, he told me he sold off virtually all his liquid assets to raise the $80 million for his wager.

287,Northstar Group-Backed Delta Dunia Deepens Australia Mining Investments,"A unit of Delta Dunia Makmur—an Indonesian miner backed by tycoon tycoon Patrik Walujo private equity firm Northstar Group—is deepening its mining investments in Australia with the acquisition of a stake in listed copper miner, 29Metals. Bukit Makmur Mandiri Utama (BUMA), an indirect subsidiary of Delta Dunia, said Tuesday it will buy an almost 20% stake in 29Metals for A$62 million ($39.8 million). With the investment, Delta Dunia is diversifying its Australian portfolio into copper and zinc mining, enabling the group to tap into the booming demand for electric vehicles worldwide. “The strategic transaction reinforces our commitment to diversification and growth into future-facing commodities and builds on our recent significant acquisitions,” Ronald Sutardja, president director of Delta Dunia Group, said in a statement. “This transaction represents a tangible step in Delta Dunia Group’s strategic long-term goal to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, while diversifying our portfolio to align with a more sustainable future.” With the 29Metals deal, Delta Dunia has signed over $617 million worth of transactions in Australia and the U.S. this year as the Jakarta-listed company seeks to diversify beyond its home market in Indonesia. Last month, it agreed to buy 51% of Dawson Complex, one of the largest metallurgical coal mines in Australia, for $455 million. In July, Delta Dunia’s announced the acquisition of Pennsylvania miner Atlantic Carbon Group, for $122.4 million. Delta Dunia plans to finance 29Metals acquisition, slated for completion this month, with its cash reserves and bank loans. The company is making the investment as part of a A$180 million share sale by 29Metals, which is raising fresh capital to fund the development of the Gossan Valley mine located in Golden Grove in western Australia. Aside from its expansion abroad, Delta Dunia also has been securing significant deals in Indonesia. In October, Indonesia Pratama—a unit of billionaire Low Tuck Kwong’s Bayan Resources—awarded a 107.8 trillion rupiah ($6.8 billion) coal mining services contract to BUMA.

25,The Associated Press’ top photos of 2024 from the US,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The right frame can freeze a moment in time, creating meaning for the masses from a fist pump over a bloodied ear, a bridge crumbled by a ship, towns shredded by nature, and a victory sealed with an on-field kiss. NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The right frame can freeze a moment in time, creating meaning for the masses from a fist pump over a bloodied ear, a bridge crumbled by a ship, towns shredded by nature, and a victory sealed with an on-field kiss. In 2024, photographers across the U.S. captured glimpses of humanity, ranging from a deeply divisive presidential election, to hurricanes and fires that ravaged communities, to campus protests over the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The gallery from The Associated Press illustrates a new chapter of political history — the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, the moment President Joe Biden announced he would no longer run again, the campaign sprint by Vice President Kamala Harris in Biden’s place, and the raw emotion from voters during a grueling contest ultimately won by Trump. Hurricanes whipped through the country with devastating imagery, leaving a path of wreckage and death from Florida to Appalachia. After Hurricane Helene, Lake Lure in North Carolina was shown in a jarring photo covered in shards of debris thick enough to hide the surface of the water. Hurricane Milton ripped apart the roof of Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, home to Major League Baseball’s Tampa Bay Rays. The scale of destruction experienced in some corners of the country in 2024 was hard to capture and might have been harder to fathom. That was the case when a container ship slammed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, causing it to collapse and crumple around the vessel, killing construction workers on the bridge. As flames torched the landscape in California, another image captured firefighters and sheriff’s deputies pushing a vintage car away from a burning home. Elsewhere in California, one photo is aglow with bright orange flames, broken up only by the subtle features of an animal running through them. But hope also persevered in the face of devastation. In Helene’s aftermath, an image from Crystal River, Florida, shows Dustin Holmes holding hands with his girlfriend, Hailey Morgan, as they sloshed through floodwaters with her 4- and 7-year-old children to return to their flooded home. And in Manasota Key, Florida, a family was lit up by the glow of flashlights as they walked to check on their home damaged by Milton. Other photos from 2024 also grabbed the darkness and shadows to emphasize light: among them, a rocket liftoff and a total solar eclipse. And, yes, eclipse glasses were back in style for a shared moment of skygazing.

380,NYC Mayor Says He’ll Work with Trump to Deport Illegal Immigrant Criminals: ‘Cancel Me’,"New York City mayor Eric Adams on Tuesday expressed an openness to deporting illegal immigrants who have committed crimes, further distancing himself from more progressive members of his party on the issue. He said he hopes to meet with President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for border czar, Tom Homan. “I would love to sit down with the border czar and hear his thoughts on how we are going to address those who are harming our citizens,” Adams said on Tuesday. “Find out what his plans are, where our common grounds are. We can work together.” Adams made sure to clarify that deportation out of the Big Apple should only be reserved for violent illegal aliens, not productive illegal immigrants or “Dreamers.” “Those who are here committing crimes, robberies, shooting at police officers, raping innocent people, have been a harm to our country. Those are the people I am talking about,” Adams said. “I made it clear that I’m not going to be warring with this administration. I’m going to be working with this administration,” he added. Adams has suggested that the criminal charges brought against him were, at least partially, politically motivated. He claimed he was targeted because of his criticisms of President Joe Biden’s overly-permissive immigration policy. “Know what’s interesting? I want you to all go back and Google Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama,” Adams said. “Google what they said about those who commit crimes in our city and … in our country. They said those who commit crimes need to get out right away. That was their position. So this is not a new position.” But, Adams claimed, progressives have grown afraid to speak out against illegal immigration because of cancel culture. “Well, cancel me because I’m going to protect the people of the city. And if you come into this country, in this city, and think you’re going to harm innocent New Yorkers and innocent migrants and asylum seekers, this is not the mayor you want to be in the city under. “ This hardened stance comes as New York City has battled a massive influx in asylum-seekers, illegal immigrants, and refugees throughout Biden’s tenure. “I’m an American. Americans have certain rights. The Constitution is for Americans. And I’m not a person that snuck into this country. My ancestors have been here for a long time, for a long time,” the mayor said. Adams won his mayoral seat by largely running as a moderate force, specifically by touting his law enforcement background and promising to clamp down on crime. “I’ve said it over and over again. We need to fix the immigration problem in this city. The American people said that. I don’t know if you really watch the election results. The president-elect hit the popular vote, hit the electoral vote. He was not indecisive on what his positions were. He was clear we need to secure our border deal with the immigration issue.” “The American people heard it. They voted for it,” he said.

The article presents New York City Mayor Eric Adams' willingness to collaborate with former President Trump's administration on immigration enforcement, particularly against illegal immigrants who commit crimes. It highlights a moderate, crime-focused stance on immigration, which may resonate more with conservative perspectives. The emphasis on law enforcement and security aligns with a lean-right viewpoint, especially in contrast to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party that typically advocates for more lenient immigration policies. The mayor's criticisms of his party's stance also suggest a divergence from left-leaning positions."
111,The Left Seethes At Trump’s Triumph As A Cultural Icon,"President-elect Donald Trump went from a former commander-in-chief with a polarizing exit to a cultural icon whose re-election over a mugshot and two assassination attempts defined one of the greatest American comebacks of all time. Enter the “Trump dance” as a nationwide celebration of the ex-president’s triumph over four years of dystopian rule by a condescending administration. Trump’s signature moves to his popular campaign anthem, the Village People’s “Y.M.C.A.,” have taken the internet by storm after being performed by online influencers and athletes all across the sports world. This is what you call Respect. There’s a new dance craze and it’s called the Donald Trump pic.twitter.com/bnGG5N0OMc The left, which suddenly exempted themselves from their own lockdowns to parade in crowded streets because their candidate won four years ago, is now having a hard time watching Americans relish in Trump’s massive victory. [RELATED: Donald Trump Made The GOP Cool Again] “Athletes will come to regret their ‘Trump dance’ celebrations,” headlined an op-ed in USA Today by an author named Nancy Armour. “As anyone over the age of, oh, 12 can tell you, what seems cool today will make you cringe in the future,” Armour wrote. “So it will be with athletes and their ‘Trump dance’ celebrations.” “Actually, mimicking president-elect Donald Trump’s dance moves looks dumb in the moment,” Armour added. She sounds fun. A few paragraphs later, Armour actually wrote, “It’s all fun and games until people start getting deported.” Well ok, if we’re going to go there, someone might ask the family of murdered 22-year-old Laken Riley how much they’ve enjoyed the “fun and games” of an illegal immigrant from Venezuela slaughtering her. The killer, Jose Ibarra, was handed a life sentence Wednesday, wherein he’ll live on the government payroll the rest of their life. On Sunday, a panel on CNN featured pundits who characterized Trump as a “Republican Caesar” following the president-elect’s appearance at Saturday night’s UFC event in New York City’s Madison Square Garden. Trump walked into the legacy venue with an entourage of some of the most recognizable personalities from his campaign now preparing to staff the new administration, such as Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, Tulsi Gabbard, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Also present at the fight where Trump held one of the most significant rallies of his latest campaign included UFC President Dana White, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, and the president-elect’s two sons, Donald Trump Jr., and Eric Trump. “It really looks like ancient Rome here,” said Bulwark reporter Marc Caputo. “This is sort of the conquering Republican Caesar who’s going into The Colosseum and everyone’s cheering, and he’s got his political gladiators with him.” Was that supposed to be an insult? Normal Americans (and normal gays) who aren’t allergic to testosterone yet might call it remarkable. Indeed, Heavyweight Champion Jon Jones celebrated his victory in the headline event with the “Trump dance” and thanked the president-elect for being there as the fighter defended the UFC title. “I’m proud to be a great American champion,” Jones said in the cage with the display of high-octane patriotism that used to unite the country. Patriotism is cool again four years after the Democrat Party denigrated Mount Rushmore out of self-hatred. Jones even went on to shake hands with the president-elect after handing Trump the championship belt. Incredible moment of respect when Jon Jones handed his UFC championship belt to President Trump. The culture is changing. I love this. 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/qgb3BjgLOK “That appearance isn’t just about him enjoying the applause,” Caputo said on CNN. “He’s sending a message to the Senate. Like, not only, ‘are you entertained?’ But, ‘these are my people, and are you willing to fight? Because here’s who I have.'” Trump did, after all, vow on election night usher in the “golden age of America” with echoes of the “Pax Romana,” which refers to the roughly 200-year era of unprecedented prosperity for the Roman Empire between 27 BC to 180 AD. “We’re going to fix everything about our country, and we’ve made history for a reason tonight,” Trump said. “This will truly be the golden age of America.” The “Pax Romana” also happens to translate to “Roman peace.” While Trump detractors are constantly out to characterize him as an unhinged authoritarian, American voters spoke clearly when they elected their “Republican Caesar” and tossed the incumbent regime, which has pushed the world closer to nuclear conflict and zealously prosecuted its top political opponent. In other words, democracy was kept safe as Americans welcomed the candidate who promised world peace.",Federalist,Right,755,"Right

105,Trump’s Labor Sec Pick Sided With Dems On Major Pro-Union Bills Before Getting Nod,"Outgoing Republican Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to run the Department of Labor (DOL), previously sided with Democrats on a bill that would upend right-to-work laws and has assumed other positions at odds with GOP orthodoxy. Chavez-DeRemer, who represented Oregon’s 5th district in the House as a Republican before getting the nod from Trump to run the DOL, supported the PRO Act, a major piece of legislation targeting the private sector that was at the top of President Joe Biden’s wishlist. Moreover, Chavez-DeRemer also backs the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, which would strengthen public sector unions — typically bastions of institutional support for Democrats — at a time when Trump is motivated to cut government bloat and weaken the influence of unelected bureaucrats over the policymaking process. Some Senate Republicans are not totally enthused by Trump’s decision to nominate Chavez-DeRemer, according to The Washington Post, though a few Senate Democrats — including left-wing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren — have tentatively signaled that they are open to supporting Chavez-DeRemer, according to National Review. “I plan to hold President-elect Trump’s feet to the fire for working people, and I look forward to hearing more from Congresswoman Lori Chavez-DeRemer. It’s a big deal that one of the few Republican lawmakers who have endorsed the PRO Act could lead the Department of Labor,” Warren said in a Tuesday statement. “If Chavez-DeRemer commits as labor secretary to strengthen labor unions and promote worker power, she’s a strong candidate for the job. But this nomination is an early test: will Trump stand strong with workers or bow down to his corporate donors and the Republican establishment’s opposition?” The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), a massive labor union that backed Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race, praised Chavez-DeRemer’s record on labor issues in a statement addressing her nomination while noting that it remains to be seen how she will run the DOL for Trump. The National Education Association, a major teachers union that donated overwhelmingly to Democrats in the 2024 elections, also praised Chavez-DeRemer’s record in a statement following her nomination. Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, wrote in a post to X that Chavez-DeRemer’s nomination is “significant.” “It is significant that the Pres-elect nominated Rep. Chavez-DeRemer for Labor. Her record suggests real support of workers & their right to unionize,” Weingarten wrote. “I hope it means the Trump admin will actually respect collective bargaining and workers’ voices from Teamsters to teachers.” Business interests reportedly opposed Chavez-DeRemer as a potential labor secretary, and the Teamsters — a major labor union — successfully lobbied for her to get the job, according to Politico. While a September poll showed that nearly 60% of rank-and-file Teamsters backed Trump in the recent election, Teamsters President Sean O’Brien opted against endorsing either candidate in the race. With respect to the PRO Act, Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three House Republicans to endorse the bill upon its most recent introduction in the chamber. Democrats broadly support the PRO Act, while most Republicans oppose it because they view the bill as one that would curb worker choice and saddle consumers with increased costs while quashing state-level “right to work” laws opposed by major labor unions. For his part, Trump has hailed Chavez-DeRemer as an individual who can effectively bridge the divide between business and labor. “I am proud to hereby nominate Lori Chavez-DeRemer, from the Great State of Oregon, as United States Secretary of Labor. Lori has worked tirelessly with both Business and Labor to build America’s workforce, and support the hardworking men and women of America,” Trump said in his Truth Social post announcing his selection of Chavez-DeRemer. “I look forward to working with her to create tremendous opportunity for American Workers, to expand Training and Apprenticeships, to grow wages and improve working conditions, to bring back our Manufacturing jobs. Together, we will achieve historic cooperation between Business and Labor that will restore the American Dream for Working Families.” Assuming Chavez-DeRemer does not abandon her support for the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, at least in spirit, she may find herself at odds with one of the Trump administration’s major initiatives. Billionaire businessmen Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk have stated that they will seek to reduce the size of the federal government’s workforce as the directors of the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) — a leading union for federal workers — has railed against DOGE’s push to trim the federal workforce and supports the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, as Chavez-DeRemer did in her capacity as a legislator. “Lori Chavez-DeRemer is honored to be President-elect Trump’s nominee for Secretary at the U.S. Department of Labor. If confirmed, she will look forward to advancing the policies set forth by the Trump-Vance Administration,” a spokesperson for Chavez-DeRemer told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Out of the utmost respect for the Senate and their constitutional responsibility, she will reserve comment for the confirmation hearing.” The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment.",IJR,Right,857,"Center

177,GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy draws primary challenger citing Trump impeachment vote,"Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., will face at least one primary challenger in 2026, with Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming announcing Wednesday that he will run for the seat held by the two-term senator, citing Cassidy’s vote to convict Donald Trump after his 2021 impeachment trial. Fleming, a former member of Congress, said in a statement that Cassidy “has failed the people of Louisiana,” “A number of Republicans walked away from President Trump in the last year of his first term,” Fleming said, “but those who turned their backs on him and America First were not committed to his fight to make America great. Louisiana citizens did not give up on this fight.” Cassidy campaign spokesman Joe Ramallo said in a statement: “I thought he wanted to be State Treasurer? John Fleming wants to get out of Louisiana. He publicly said he wanted a job in the Trump administration, and apparently they didn’t want him. So after less than a year as State Treasurer, he’s looking for another job to return to Washington.” Cassidy has not yet formally announced that he is running for re-election, but he told the Shreveport Times last month that he is ""obviously working hard toward 2026.” Cassidy was one of three Senate Republicans who voted to convict Trump in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol who are still serving in the chamber, along with Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski and Maine’s Susan Collins, who is also up for re-election in 2026. After the House voted to impeach Trump, the Senate acquitted him. While Collins represents a state Vice President Kamala Harris carried in last month's elections, Cassidy is up for re-election in ruby-red Louisiana, which backed Trump by 22 points. Fleming, who overlapped with Cassidy when both were in the House, touted his work as a senior adviser to Trump during his first administration. ""I cannot fully express the deep sense of pride I have, having served President Trump in the West Wing of the White House as he was literally fighting for his political life against those who were attacking him and turning their backs on him,” Fleming said, “but the opportunity to stand with him for the principles of America First is why I seek to serve the citizens of Louisiana in the United States Senate.” Fleming was elected state treasurer last year. Cassidy's primary will look different than his past races after state legislators changed Louisiana's primary system earlier this year. The state will now have closed primaries for congressional elections, with separate Republican and Democratic contests. Louisiana had previously held ""jungle primaries"" where candidates from all parties competed on the same primary ballot.",NBC,Lean Left,444,"Lean Right  
The article focuses on the challenges faced by Republican Senator Bill Cassidy due to his impeachment vote against Donald Trump, emphasizing the perspectives of his primary challenger who advocates for Trump’s principles.

208,Trump picks former Sen. Kelly Loeffler for small business administrator,"President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he will nominate former Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., to lead the Small Business Administration in his second term. ""I am very pleased to nominate business leader and former U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler, from the Great State of Georgia, to serve as Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA),"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Trump called Loeffler ""a tremendous fighter in the U.S. Senate during the first Trump Administration"" and said she would ""bring her experience in business and Washington to reduce red tape, and unleash opportunity for our Small Businesses to grow, innovate, and thrive."" Trump announced last month that Loeffler would co-chair the organization planning his inauguration. Loeffler, 53, represented Georgia in the Senate for just over a year in 2020 and 2021, filling the seat left by the late Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., when he resigned because of health reasons. She ran in the 2020 special election for the seat but lost in a runoff election to Democrat Raphael Warnock. After the 2020 election, as Trump pushed his claims of widespread voter fraud, Loeffler repeatedly refused to acknowledge that he had lost the presidential election. NBC News reported last year that a special grand jury in Georgia that initially investigated Trump's efforts to overturn the election results recommended indicting more than three dozen people, including 21 who weren't charged in the Fulton County case. Loeffler was among those the panel recommended, but she was ultimately not charged. Trump has named other choices for his future Cabinet who also expressed doubt about his loss in the 2020 election, including Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., his pick for ambassador to the U.N.; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., chosen for secretary of state; and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, selected for attorney general. Loeffler is the founder of the company RallyRight, which is described as “a suite of technology products designed to empower conservatives with the necessary tools to win at every level.” She is also on the board for the application PublicSquare, which is described as the “largest marketplace & payments ecosystem that protects life, family, and freedom.” She previously owned a 49% stake in the WNBA’s Atlanta Dream, which was sold in 2021. The small business administrator is subject to Senate confirmation.",NBC,Lean Left,377,"Lean Right  
The article primarily focuses on the nomination of Kelly Loeffler, a Republican ally of Donald Trump, without critical analysis or opposing viewpoints. It presents her qualifications and previous support for Trump’s policies, indicating a favorable tone. The lack of substantial critique regarding her past and context about the controversies surrounding Trump’s claims about the 2020 election further supports a lean towards right-leaning bias. Coverage is consistent with a pro-Republican narrative found in right-leaning media outlets."

Advancing American Freedom urged the DOGE bosses to trim the fat off the federal bureaucracy and cut a host of costly spending programs, several of which were imposed by President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ administration — including provisions from their $740 billion Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). “The American people want less government in their lives and want the government to spend less of their money on wasteful and woke programs,” said AAF president Tim Chapman. 5 Elon Musk arrives on Capitol Hill with his son X A A-Xii on December 5, 2024, in Washington, DC. Getty Images “Advancing American Freedom wants to help advance the vision of DOGE to improve the lives of everyday Americans,” added Chapman, urging DOGE “to cut through the overwhelming maze of bureaucracy and reassure the American people that their government is accountable to them for how their taxes are being spent.” The memo calls for ending federal benefit programs tasked with helping illegal immigrants, prohibiting federal funding for programs that push diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and clawing back unspent COVID-19 money.

Another long-held GOP priority that made the list was mandating that all able-bodied workers be kicked off welfare. 5 Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy (center), co-chair of the newly announced Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), walks with Sen. Joni Ernst (right) as he arrives on Capitol Hill on December 5, 2024, in Washington, DC. Getty Images Musk and Ramaswamy went to Capitol Hill on Thursday to discuss their unprecedented budget-cutting plans with GOP lawmakers, many of whom welcomed their ideas. DOGE, named after the cryptocurrency with a Shiba Inu as its mascot, will be committed to shutting down redundant agencies and firing useless government employees, Musk and Ramaswamy have both said. “We need to make sure we’re spending public money well,” Musk told reporters on his way out of a meeting with soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD). A significant portion of congressional Republicans support a smaller federal government, but DOGE — which is not a government department — could potentially run into hurdles lowering budgets if just a few dissenting GOPers push back in Congress. 5 Ramaswamy walks by the Capitol building speaking to reporters about DOGE. Getty Images “Two people who know nothing about how the government works pretending they can cut a trillion dollars, both with decent pulpits to preach from, and the ear of an unpredictable president? Disaster,” one senior Republican aide griped to Punchbowl News. “The only good thing is that at some point they’ll overpromise and get bounced by [President-elect Donald] Trump. But until then … disaster.” There was also uncertainty from lawmakers who huddled with Musk and Ramaswamy over what exactly DOGE is and how exactly the two bombastic entrepreneurs intend to push through dramatic spending cuts. “I don’t know what legal authority they have,” Rep. Max Miller (R-Ohio) admitted to reporters after a large meeting with Musk and Ramaswamy when asked about whether the duo believes they have sufficient independent power or intend to act in an advisory role. “That I don’t know,” Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) added when asked about the accountability line behind DOGE and whether it could face Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. During their meeting with a large ensemble of lawmakers right before votes on the House floor, Musk and Ramaswamy spoke for about a minute and then turned to the microphone over to reps for an extensive ideas session. They also indicated that similar meetings of that nature will follow down the line. At least one idea floated was impoundment, something endorsed by Office of Management and Budget director-designee Russell Vought and in which the executive branch would simply refuse to spend funds allocated by Congress. “The president, personally I believe, has the constitutional authority, and I think there was some significant agreement in the room,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said. “I told these guys the best thing they could do is highlight all of the nonsense that Congress continues to fund — and then that way Congress has to bear its burden as appropriators and spenders of the power of the purse,” he recounted. At one point, Musk and Ramaswamy pitched a Christmas-themed suggestion of a “naughty and nice list” for reps, according to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who chairs the House DOGE Caucus. Musk, who paraded around the Capitol Thursday with his four-year-old son X Æ A-Xii on his shoulders, also stressed the need to check every single federal payment that goes out. There wasn’t a specific figure given for cuts or a precise game plan for DOGE, according to about a dozen lawmakers in attendance. There was also a sense of urgency in the room and a strong conviction shared by attendees that Congress needs to tackle the soaring national debt. Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-SC) noted that one of his takeaways is that there is a sense that the federal government lags behind the private sector in the use of critical technology that could make its operations more efficient. He also commended the incoming administration’s outreach to Congress. So far, Musk and Ramaswamy’s are being met publicly with positive feedback from Republican lawmakers — with Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) introducing legislation to bolster DOGE’s efforts. Fox News’ Martha MacCallum asked House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) on Wednesday if it would be possible to enact Musk’s plan to cut the 428 government agencies down to 99. 5 Musk has vowed to eliminate excess costs from the federal budget through DOGE. Getty Images “We certainly hope so, we want to be willing partners in that,” Johnson replied, pointing to the Supreme Court overturning the 1984 Chevron doctrine earlier this year as an indication that control is being taken back from ham-handed federal regulators. “It’s a new thing and this is a new day in Washington, a new day in America. We have long lamented the size and scope of the government — that it has grown too large,” Johnson told reporters in the hallway Thursday. “There’s an enormous amount of waste, fraud and abuse.” Musk has been Trump’s top confidant at Mar-a-Lago in the weeks following the 45th president’s re-election, advising him on transition moves and weighing in on calls with foreign dignitaries. 5 Musk has been Trump’s top confidant at Mar-a-Lago in the weeks following the 45th president’s re-election, advising him on transition moves and weighing in on calls with foreign dignitaries. Getty Images The DOGE initiative comes as a natural progression of the two business titans’ opprobrium for the “swamp” and rooting out government excess — just as Musk did with Twitter, now X, when he eliminated the majority of the staff. “Look, it’s a refreshing idea that we’re going to actually make government work better and make your taxpayers go further,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” before his Musk-Ramaswamy sitdown. “There are probably 75% of federal employees here in Washington that still are not showing up to work under the excuse of COVID.” “The swamp is elitist and bipartisan,” Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) said on X ahead of his own meeting with the pair. “I look forward to hearing from [Elon Musk] and [Vivek Ramaswamy] today on Capitol Hill.” Disdain for unelected, meddling government employees was a centerpiece of Ramaswamy’s own presidential campaign — and he hopes to continue in that vein in the second Trump administration. “I have a passion for tearing down bureaucracy,” Ramaswamy told The Post in late October. “And that’s something I’ve been vocal about over the last two years.”",NewYorkPost,Lean Right,1415,"Lean Right

168,"As Hegseth's fight to head Pentagon lags, Trump not working the phones to save him: Sources","Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary, was back on Capitol Hill on Thursday to meet with Republican lawmakers as misconduct allegations continued to cloud his selection to lead the Pentagon. Behind the scenes, Trump's political team is focused on figuring out where female Republican senators stand on Hegseth, according to two people involved in the conversations. Trump's advisers are fully aware that with such a thin GOP Senate majority, Hegseth's fate could all come down to the women in the conference. Sen. Joni Ernst, a key Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee that will hold his confirmation hearings, notably declined to voice support for Hegseth after meeting with him on Wednesday and then again on Thursday on Fox News, which Trump is known to watch. Ernst told Fox News host Bill Hemmer she had a ""very frank"" and ""productive"" discussion with Hegseth. When pressed by Hemmer that that didn't sound as if she had gotten to a yes on his confirmation, she replied, ""I think you are right."" Ernst is the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate and a sexual assault survivor herself. Hegseth has faced allegations of sexual assault (which he's denied) and previously said that women should not serve in ground combat roles in the military. ABC News was told Trump has expressed to those close to him that Hegseth should have been more honest and forthcoming about the challenges he could face getting through the confirmation process given his history. Trump, who is considering other options (a list that includes Ernst) for the role, has not been working the phones for Hegseth -- as he did for Matt Gaetz. Gaetz was Trump's original pick for attorney general but said he withdrew his name from consideration as he faced his own allegations of sexual misconduct. Trump has since tapped former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi to head up the Justice Department, pending Senate confirmation. Hegseth has told senators his mother has been making calls to senators on his behalf, according to sources familiar with the matter. He has also told senators he is open to a background check, according to multiple sources. During Wednesday's meetings with GOP senators, Hegseth promised some he would not drink alcohol if confirmed. ""The allegation was made about him being intoxicated at several times and so the questions that every member will be asking him led to his statement,"" said Sen. Roger Wicker, current ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and expected to take over the chairmanship in January -- presiding over Hegseth's confirmation hearings. Hegseth on Thursday was expected to meet with Republican Sens. Rick Scott of Florida, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Jim Banks of Indiana, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Hegseth told reporters as he walked through the Capitol that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday morning. ""He is behind us all the way,"" Hegseth said when asked by ABC News' Jay O'Brien what Trump had told him during their conversation.

172,Why a Florida Democrat joined the DOGE caucus that's looking to cut federal spending,"A new GOP-led congressional caucus that supports President-elect Donald Trump's push to cut trillions in federal spending has welcomed a Democrat. This week, Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Florida joined the Department of Government Efficiency caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming the first Democrat to do so. The caucus would partner with DOGE, the unofficial advisory body led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy tasked with regulating government spending. Moskowitz, who represents a ""middle of the road"" Florida district that includes Boca Raton and Ft. Lauderdale, said joining doesn't mean he fully shares Trump's agenda. ""On some issues I'm progressive. On other issues I'm conservative, and I think that's how most of my constituents are,"" Moskowitz told Morning Edition. ""We take it issue by issue."" In a conversation with NPR's Steve Inskeep, Moskowitz said the issues he cares about don't fall on just one side of the political spectrum and explained why he feels it's important for Democrats to be part of conversations about cutting spending. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity Steve Inskeep: I'm really interested in how you phrased that. You didn't say on some issues I'm progressive, on others I'm more moderate. You said straight out conservative. You didn't choke on that word, which I think some progressives might. Rep. Jared Moskowitz: When it comes to the budget, I think fiscal conservatism is a good thing. I think most Americans want to pay the least amount of taxes possible, but still get the most amount of services out of that. So if they're right on something, we should support it. We shouldn't just be the opposition party of ""since they came up with it, we can't support it because we don't want to give them a win."" But we also need to push back when they want to do stupid things. Inskeep: Well, let's try to explain for people what this DOGE caucus is. The Department on Government Efficiency is an outside group Musk and Ramaswamy are leading under the auspices of President Trump. Ultimately, they make suggestions to Congress. And the caucus is volunteering to take in those suggestions, correct? Moskowitz: I joined the caucus, which is just congressional members. We have lots of caucuses. We have the bourbon caucus, the dog caucus, the sneaker caucus, the Hispanic caucus, progressive caucus. Now, these caucuses don't have any power. This caucus has no power, does not take any votes. It's a group of members that get together and have conversations. Look, I don't know any American who thinks the government is perfect. If there are people with legitimate suggestions on how we can improve government efficiency, bring technology to government, or figure out where there's waste and fraud to save taxpayer dollars, we should do that. It shouldn't be a partisan issue. Inskeep: Do you think you have the same idea of government efficiency as Musk does, based on some of his public statements so far? Moskowitz: No, I'm sure there's lots of things that Elon and Vivek are going to propose that I'm going to say are wrong and will not work. And I look forward to that conversation. But when in America do we not even want to have the conversation? This idea of staying in your safe space and only talking to people you agree with didn't work for us in the last election. So we need to go into rooms and have comfortable and uncomfortable conversations. Inskeep: Musk and Ramaswamy have talked about eliminating entire cabinet departments like the Department of Education, and getting rid of billions of dollars of veterans benefits. Moskowitz: Twitter is not real life. Inskeep: You don't think they really want to do that? Moskowitz: They don't have the votes to do that. Just because they've made statements like that, I'm not willing to shy away from the overall conversation that government can't become more efficient. Inskeep: In the statement you made saying that you were going to join the DOGE caucus, you didn't talk about eliminating entire cabinet departments. You specified that there were a couple of parts of the Department of Homeland Security that you thought were in the wrong place and ought to be moved. You seem to have a way more modest idea of what efficiency could mean. Moskowitz: I've put forward that bill to remove FEMA from DHS since I've been in Congress. FEMA is becoming more and more important. Disasters are becoming bigger, and affecting greater areas. They're becoming more expensive. FEMA should be a cabinet level agency, and I don't think FEMA can do the job the American people need it to do as long as it sits in Homeland Security. I also think, based on my experience with the assassination task force of Donald Trump, the Secret Service needs dramatic changes there. I don't think the agency will be able to remake itself in a giant bureaucracy of 21 other agencies. So my singular focus is to get those two agencies out of DHS and make them direct reports to the White House. At the same time, if there are tens of billions, or hundreds of billions of dollars that we can save in agencies and still deliver the same services, why wouldn't we have the conversation? Just because we have the conversation doesn't mean we're gonna vote for it. They're gonna have these conversations. We should be in the room. This story was edited by Obed Manuel.

This article presents a balanced perspective by detailing the bipartisan efforts to address federal spending while incorporating the views of a Democrat involved in a GOP-led caucus. It avoids extreme language or partisan criticism, and instead promotes constructive dialogue on government efficiency.

83,Dem Sen. Murphy: We Should ‘Come After Elon Musk’ He ‘Made His Fortune Off of Taxpayers’,"On Thursday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Katy Tur Reports,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) questioned the effectiveness of the Department of Government Efficiency and stated that Elon Musk “basically has made his fortune off of government subsidies” and Democrats should “come after the insurance companies, the big defense companies that are all reaping huge amounts of money off of the government. Let’s come after Elon Musk, who’s made his fortune off of taxpayers.” Murphy said, “I’m just not sure that [DOGE] has anything to do with breaking up the status quo. You’ve put a billionaire, who basically has made his fortune off of government subsidies in charge of deciding how the government should spend its money. This sounds like either a con job, in which Elon Musk comes out of this with his programs protected, and perhaps his competitors’ programs targeted or just a TV show. … So, yes, I think Democrats should put on the table how we think we can cut government. Let’s come after the drug companies, come after the insurance companies, the big defense companies that are all reaping huge amounts of money off of the government. Let’s come after Elon Musk, who’s made his fortune off of taxpayers. Democrats should be involved in the conversation about government efficiency. I just don’t know that this group has anything to do with actual, meaningful commonsense cuts.

Fallon yelled about Rowe's attendance at the 9/11 memorial. He accused Rowe of putting the President's Secret Service detail out of position so he could sit behind him during the 9/11 remembrance ceremony. ""Congressman, what you're not seeing is the [lack] of the detail off out of the picture's view. And that is the day where we remember more than 3,000 people that have died on 9/11,"" Rowe said Thursday. ""I actually responded to Ground Zero. I was there going through the ashes of the World Trade Center. I was there at Fresh Kills."" Fallon yelled at Rowe, asking if he was the special agent in charge. ""I was there to show respect for members that died on 9/11,"" Rowe yelled back his finger pointing at Fallon. ""Do not invoke 9/11 for political purposes,"" Rowe shouted. ""Oh I am not,"" Fallon responded. ""You are sir,"" Rowe yelled back. ""And you are out of line!"" ""I am an elected member of Congress, and I'm asking you a serious question,"" Fallon said. ""I am a public servant who has served,"" Rowe yelled back. Fallon accused the acting director of putting the life of the vice president in jeopardy to audition for the job.

Penelope Hegseth, appearing on ""Fox & Friends"" Wednesday morning, said her son and his wife at the time were going through a ""very difficult divorce"" when she wrote the email in 2018, noting that she wrote it ""in haste"" and with ""deep emotions."" ""I wrote that out of love,"" she said. ""And about two hours later, I retracted it with an apology email, but nobody's seen that."" Hegseth's mother said in the email, published by The New York Times, that she was writing on ""behalf of all the women (and I know it's many) you have abused in some way,"" telling her son to ""get some help and take an honest look at yourself."" But Hegseth's mother said she was appearing Wednesday on Fox to ""tell the truth"" to the American people, and to Republican senators on the hill — ""especially our female senators."" Hegseth, a former ""Fox & Friends"" weekend co-host, has been meeting with Republican senators on Capitol Hill this week and before the Thanksgiving recess, looking to secure support as the chamber prepares to work on the confirmation of Trump intended Cabinet and administration nominees early next year. Meanwhile, Hegseth has faced allegations in a number of negative stories published in recent days of sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement at veterans' charities, repeated intoxication and infidelity. Hegseth has denied the allegations. Hegseth's mother encouraged the senators to ""listen to Pete,"" noting that part of the reason she appeared on Fox was to ""discredit the media."" She added that she called Fox on Tuesday saying she wanted to speak out on the issue, noting that ""I would do anything for my son."" Trump selected the 44-year-old Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan for the top Pentagon post last month. Since then, he's faced intense scrutiny, and amid the scrutiny, Trump is considering selecting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as his pick for defense secretary to potentially replace embattled Hegseth, three sources familiar with the transition told CBS News on Tuesday night. Hegseth insisted on Wednesday that he would not be withdrawing his name from consideration. He wouldn't be the first Trump nominee to withdraw: Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, initially Trump's pick to be attorney general, dropped out of consideration just days after he was tapped for the role. ""Why would I back down?"" Hegseth told CBS News. ""I've always been a fighter. I'm here for the fighters. This is personal and passionate for me."" Hegseth's mother repeatedly defended her son during the appearance on Wednesday, saying he has changed and noting that ""if we all went back seven years, we would see that maybe we are not the people we are today.""

56,"Chappell Roan, semaglutide and Kamala Harris: the most mispronounced words of 2024","At the Democratic national convention, Kamala Harris’s nieces explained how to pronounce Harris’s name. Chappell Roan gave fans a friendly “final warning” about the pronunciation of hers. And Zendaya settled the matter on video. All three helped to define 2024 – and spent the year hearing people get their names wrong: each appears on lists of the year’s most mispronounced words in the US and UK, produced by the language-learning website Babbel, which reminds us that they’re pronounced COM-a-la HAR-iss, CHAP-uhl ROHN and Zen-DAY-a. The lists, created with the closed-captioning and subtitling companies the Captioning Group and the British Institute of Verbatim Reporters, show the stars in good company: among the other mispronounced names and words are Barry Keoghan (BARR-ee key-OH-gin, with a hard g), the Irish actor and star of Saltburn, and Pete Buttigieg (Boot-Edge-Edge), the US transportation secretary. But it wasn’t just humans whose names were mispronounced. Among this year’s other list-makers: The Dutch Kooikerhondje (COY-ker-HUND-che), a breed of dog owned by the world’s best baseball player, Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ohtani’s dog won fans after “throwing” the first pitch at a game (he carried the ball from the pitcher’s mound to his crouching owner at home plate). Shein, the fast-fashion site – it’s SHE-in, not SHEEN or SHINE. The drug in the weight-loss medications Ozempic and Wegovy is semaglutide (sem-ah-GLOO-tide). Phryge, the mascot of the Paris Olympics and summer Paralympics, is pronounced FREE-je. It was a nod to the Phrygian cap, an emblematic accessory of the French revolutionaries. The flygskam (FLEEG-skam) – or flight-shame – movement is pushing people to cut down on flying to help the planet. Also in the word of professional sports: Joško Gvardiol (YOSH-ko GVAR-dee-ol) plays soccer (FOOT-ball) for Manchester City and Croatia. And the mispronunciation of the word espresso (es-PRESS-oh) as ex-PRESS-oh sparked outrage among some coffee fans. The word has been in the news thanks to the song by Sabrina Carpenter, who also made headlines for her relationship with Keoghan. Why all the mispronunciation? Blame it, in part, on the Norman invasion of 1066. English spelling is incredibly confusing thanks to the ways it has combined other languages, says Nicole Holliday, acting associate professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley. On top of that, there’s the linguistic “instability” that comes from the democratization of news. If one person mispronounces a name in a video for their thousands of TikTok followers, it can have a knock-on effect. That’s probably not so new. “I imagine before TV news, there were people saying politicians’ names all kinds of wild ways,” having only read them in the newspaper, Holliday says. Finally, there’s the phenomenon of words becoming what Holliday describes as “shibboleths” – in this case, words that can distinguish an in-group from an out-group. That certainly seems to be the case for Harris, whose name was mispronounced by almost half the speakers at the Republican national convention this summer – getting it wrong showed you were aligned with Donald Trump, who said he “couldn’t care less” about getting it right. But shibboleths can extend beyond politics: pronouncing your favorite celebrity’s name in a certain way, for instance, might indicate that you’re a real fan. Meanwhile, as with any list of words of the year, the document offers a look back, Esteban Touma, of Babbel, told the Associated Press. As Roan’s music gained popularity over the year, it was an interesting cultural moment to watch as people learned to pronounce her name, he said. “The way we create understanding with each other is just trying to do these things,” Touma said. The Associated Press contributed reporting",TheGuardiadn,Left,606,"Lean Left  
The article presents a lighthearted take on mispronunciations of names associated with prominent public figures, particularly from the Democratic party. It subtly highlights the mispronunciation of Kamala Harris's name at the Republican national convention, framing it as a marker of political alignment.

Overall, the piece has a more favorable tone towards figures and ideas associated with left-leaning politics."
51,New York judge refuses to marry same-sex couple 'because of her religious beliefs': report,"A civil judge in Syracuse, New York recently refused to officiate a wedding between two women, in an apparent violation of anti-discrimination laws. That's according to a Wednesday article in the Syracuse Post-Standard, which reported that Judge Felicia Pitts Davis walked out of her chambers on November 16 as soon as a same-sex couple walked in. The couple — 33 year-old Shawntay Davis and 29 year-old Niccora Davis — were left alone in the chambers until another city court judge, Mary Anne Doherty, came in and officiated their wedding. ""The way [Pitts Davis] got up and left the courtroom was rude, then all of a sudden another judge came in, and that’s when we got married,” Shawntay Davis told the Post-Standard. “It was real weird.” READ MORE: This Michigan lawmaker wants to 'make gay marriage illegal again' Pitts Davis had officiated a wedding of a heterosexual couple just prior to the Davises, and reportedly even cried during the ceremony. The Post-Standard cited two unnamed sources who said Pitts Davis told Doherty that she didn't want to marry the two women due to her ""religious beliefs."" Syracuse city court spokesperson Al Baker told the paper that the court was ""aware of the allegation and have referred the matter to the State Commission on Judicial Conduct."" Pitts Davis was elected to her 10-year term in 2020, in the wake of the Black Lives Matter uprising that swept the nation after former Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd. She told the paper at the time that she recalled watching her mother work until she was almost 90 years old, and grew uo hearing stories about racial discrimination and lynchings. ""As a Black woman, what I’ve always been taught – what I’ve fought for – has relied on the protections of the Constitution, and I had to learn how to make those real,"" she said.

232,Trump nominates billionaire SpaceX astronaut Jared Isaacman to lead NASA,"The man who commanded multiple space missions for Elon Musk has been nominated to lead NASA. President-elect Donald Trump nominated Jared Isaacman, the billionaire and repeat SpaceX astronaut, to be NASA's administrator on Wednesday. Isaacman, who is also the CEO of the payments company Shift4, recently made history by leading the first private spacewalk with SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission. The five-day mission took Isaacman and three others further from Earth than anyone has traveled since the Apollo moon missions. ""We have to keep going,"" Isaacman said about space exploration in a November interview with Business Insider. ""We just got to proceed with caution and just make sure we get it right. And if we do, we stand to learn so much that can change the course of trajectory of humankind."" Isaacman also previously helped finance and lead the world's first all-civilian private spaceflight. That was also a SpaceX mission, called Inspiration4, which Isaacman commanded. ""Jared will drive NASA's mission of discovery and inspiration, paving the way for groundbreaking achievements in Space science, technology, and exploration,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post announcing his nomination. Trump pointed to Isaacman's passion for space and ""exceptional leadership,"" demonstrated by his 25 years as the founder and CEO of Shift4. Trump also highlighted Isaacman's work as the cofounder and former CEO of Draken International, a defense aerospace company that supported the US Department of Defense, the UK, and NATO countries. ""I think that's a creative and hopeful recommendation,"" George Nield, a former head of the FAA's office of commercial space transportation, told Business Insider. ""Jared has a lot of vision and enthusiasm."" He added that, ""I would interpret this as at least an openness, if not strong advocacy, for industry playing an important role for the nation's space programs going forward."" Elon Musk, who is the founder and CEO of SpaceX and whom Trump tapped to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, said ""Congratulations"" to Isaacman on X. This would be Isaacman's first-ever role in government. ""He doesn't have experience as a government insider, and that's probably a good thing,"" Leroy Chiao, a former NASA astronaut and International Space Station commander who now works in consulting, told BI. ""He certainly has the potential to be a disruptor, so I think it's a great pick. It's much better than just status quo."" Following his nomination, Isaacman wrote in a post on X that it is ""the honor of a lifetime to serve in this role"" and work alongside NASA. ""With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,"" Isaacman said, adding that ""Americans will walk on the Moon and Mars."" Isaacman added that space holds potential for advancements in various areas including manufacturing, biotechnology, and possibly new energy sources. He also shared his vision for humanity to become a ""spacefaring civilization"" and described a ""thriving space economy"" with opportunities for people to work in space. ""I want my kids to see humans walking on the moon and Mars,"" Isaacman previously told BI. Michelle Hanlon, executive director of the Center for Air and Space Law at the University of Mississippi School of Law, told BI in an email that this was a ""perfect direction for NASA."" It's unclear whether his new role would impact his work with SpaceX or any plans he has to fly on future missions. The Polaris Program Isaacman is leading includes two more missions over the next six to nine years, including the first crewed flight of SpaceX's Starship mega-rocket. Nield said Isaacman and his team at NASA would likely assess the tradeoffs and the risk of him flying into space during his term as Administrator. ""NASA's got a great team. They've got super smart and experienced and motivated people, but they need a leader. They need a communicator,"" Nield said. ""They need someone who is not afraid to try something new if the old ways aren't working. So I think I'm excited about that choice.""",BusinessInsider,Lean Left,676,"Lean Right  
The article reports on Donald Trump's nomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA, presenting a generally positive view of both Trump and Isaacman.

The National Police Association (NPA) announced on Friday its endorsement of President-elect Donald Trump's pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, praising his record of ""transparency"" and ""accountability"" they say makes him well-positioned to head up the nation's sprawling law enforcement agency. In a statement Friday, the NPA—a nonprofit group that represents more than 240,000 U.S. police officers— praised Patel's ""distinguished career"" both as a former federal prosecutor and legal liaison to the Joint Special Operations Command.""The law enforcement community knows that effective leadership at the FBI is essential for building public trust and enhancing coordination across all levels of policing,"" the group said.

Partial transcript as follows: KASIE HUNT: President Biden sparked a wave of bipartisan backlash this week, announcing the sweeping pardon of his son, Hunter. But according to New Politico reporting, it may not be the only pardon that Biden grants. Jonathan Martin reports this. ‘President Biden’s senior– president, Joe Biden’s senior aides, are conducting a vigorous internal debate over whether to issue preemptive pardons to a range of current and former public officials who could be targeted with President elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House.’ One House Democrat already has some ideas about who should be on that list. REP. JAMES CLYBURN: Jack Smith name is on my list in this chain. Liz Cheney is on my list. I think that they all should be preemptively pardoned because I think there are people who Trump may bring into this government who will go after these people in a serious way, and there’s no need to subject them to that. HUNT: Kate Bedingfield, how real do you think this is and how how important does the White House see this? BEDINGFIELD: I think it’s real. I think they are–. I mean, look, you heard President Biden and then Vice President Harris on the campaign trail talk about what they believed Donald Trump’s abuses of power would mean. And I think that they’re taking every opportunity here to explore the options they have left in the time that they have left in office to protect people who may be subject to that attack. So, yes, I think it’s I think it is absolutely a serious process they’re undergoing. We’ll see what the ultimate outcome is.

192,"With the US caught off guard, Kim Jong Un may be about to capitalize on South Korea's turmoil","Kim Jong Un, North Korea's emboldened leader, is likely watching the events in South Korea closely and may use the turmoil to his benefit. ""We know that North Korea likes to lampoon South Korea's democratic system whenever there is tumult in Seoul,"" Edward Howell, a lecturer in politics at the University of Oxford to CNN. ""We should not be surprised if Pyongyang exploits the domestic crisis in South Korea to its advantage, either rhetorically or otherwise,"" he added. It comes after South Korea, long one of the US' most important Asian allies, was tipped into political chaos on Tuesday when its president, Yoon Suk Yeol, declared martial law. Yoon reversed course six hours later after lawmakers blocked the declaration. Calls for the president's resignation are now growing. All six opposition parties filed an impeachment motion on Wednesday, with a vote set for Friday or Saturday, according to the Yonhap news agency. Yoon said the declaration was necessary to prevent subversion by North Korea, South Korea's longtime enemy, but it's likely he was seeking to quash domestic opposition and bolster his power. North Korea may decide it's ""a great time to take advantage of this weakness to deal another blow to him through some type of provocation,"" Sydney Seiler, who until last year was the national intelligence officer for North Korea on the US National Intelligence Council, told VOA. The unrest comes at a time of heightened tensions in East Asia. South Korea has long been backed by the US, which has 30,000 troops stationed in the republic, in its decadeslong frozen war with North Korea. But North Korea, fuelled by Russian money and goods after backing the Kremlin's Ukraine invasion, is becoming more assertive and more aggressive. It's escalating its threats toward South Korea, while ally China menaces US ally Taiwan with invasion. Meanwhile, the US is seeking to bolster its democratic allies in the region to deter aggression by the axis of authoritarian states. It was reportedly caught off guard by Yoon's declaration on Tuesday but sought to project unwavering support for South Korean security as the turmoil unfolded. US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell on Tuesday said the US commitment to South Korean security remained ""ironclad."" ""We're watching the recent developments in the ROK [Republic of Korea] with grave concern,"" Campbell said. ""We're seeking to engage our ROK counterparts at every level both here and in Seoul."" Kim could use the crisis to intimidate and undermine its neighbor, and drive a wedge between South Korea and the US, say analysts. Seiler told VOA that Kim ""may see President [Yoon]'s actions as straining that relationship."" It could also take the form of propaganda designed to erode trust in democracy and government stability in South Korea. Not everyone agrees that there will be much action from North Korea, however. For one thing, US support for South Korea may act as a significant deterrent. ""North Korea is very likely to seek to capitalize politically. But the South Korea-US alliance is robust, with the two main political parties and 90% of South Koreans supporting it,"" Ramon Pacheco Pardo, Head of Department of European and International Studies at SOAS, told Business Insider. David Welch, University Research Chair and Professor of Political Science, University of Waterloo, told Newsweek that Kim is likely ""rubbing his hands with glee"" but said he was not in a good position to respond. ""I would expect some rhetorical gloating about the superiority of North Korea's political system, but not much else,"" he said.",BusinessInsider,Lean Left,585,"Center

His three-year-old, 32-person New York startup uses software to automate the gnarly calculations, aiming to save accounting teams time, improve their accuracy and help them produce reports faster. Mechanic also plans to expand beyond accounting to help private equity firms make strategic decisions on when they should sell an asset. In May 2024, Maybern raised $14 million in funding led by Primary Ventures at an $80 million valuation. It has raised $26 million since its 2021 start. There’s a growing need for software serving this space. The private capital market has nearly doubled in size over the past five years, but the technical infrastructure supporting it hasn’t kept up. “Software tools exist for them, but they’re monumentally behind,” says Emily Man, a partner at Primary Ventures who led the firm’s recent Maybern investment. And a severe shortage of accountants has made the problem much worse. Have a story tip? Contact Jeff Kauflin at jkauflin@forbes.com or on Signal at jeff.273. Ross Mechanic, whose father Jon Mechanic is a prominent real estate lawyer in New York, was working at fintech company Cadre in 2020 when he stumbled on the thorny accounting issues in private capital. As a software engineer at the startup, which helps affluent Americans invest in commercial real estate, he saw how the industry handled management-fee calculations and capital calls, where a fund asks investors to pony up the money they’ve already committed to investing. “We had a five-person team checking those numbers, and we were finding errors every quarter. It was insane to me, especially as an engineer, that we had a billion and a half under management and it was all happening in Excel.” Today, Mechanic estimates that 95% of these calculations are still done in Excel, even at the largest private equity funds. He founded Maybern in mid-2021 with former Cadre chief technology officer Ashwin Raghu, and they took two and a half years to build the software and start selling it. The product automates the calculations for the management fees an investment fund collects, the capital calls they make and the profits earned by the fund managers and the investors (also known as waterfall calculations). As a calculation tool, Excel is extremely flexible, but when multiple people work in the same large spreadsheets, it’s nearly impossible to track who has made what changes, and when. Maybern’s software is a more controlled environment that tracks those changes and tries to introduce better quality control. The startup’s target customer is an investment fund with $2 billion to $20 billion in assets under management, and its typical end-user is a fund’s controller or chief financial officer. Gauge Capital, a private equity fund with $3.5 billion in assets based in Southlake, Texas, started getting set up in Maybern’s software in May. Gauge has hundreds of investors including wealthy individuals, pension funds and college endowments, many of which have negotiated different deals with Gauge for the management fees they pay. Some investors also choose not to participate in the line of credit Gauge uses to fund some of its bets, which means those investors don’t have to help pay the interest expenses associated with it. These differences mean each investor needs a unique calculation of management fees and payouts, and each capital call must be run differently. The negotiated investment contracts “are huge legal documents that are nuanced and different for every fund, and you have to follow those to a tee because that's what the investors signed up for. That is also what the SEC would hold us accountable to,” says Megan Clarke, vice president and assistant chief compliance officer at Gauge. Calculation errors can be costly. Last year, the SEC accused the large private equity firm Insight Partners of charging too much in management fees “by inaccurately calculating management fees based on aggregated invested capital at the portfolio company level instead of at the individual portfolio investment security level, as required by the applicable limited partnership agreements.” The SEC also said Insight failed to disclose “a conflict of interest to investors relating to its fee calculations.” The charges resulted in a $1.5 million fine for Insight. For investment firms, getting started with Maybern is a time-intensive process. Gauge started sending its investment contracts and Excel files to the startup in July 2024, and Clarke thinks she’ll finally be able to use the software to run calculations for the first quarter of 2025. She expects Maybern will save her accounting staff about three days’ worth of work for each capital call (they have about six capital calls a year). Clarke also thinks Maybern will save one day of work quarterly for one of her analysts to calculate management fees. “We have so much experience, we don't need to be spending hours rolling files and trying to merge capital calls and distributions,” says Kandace Lang, fund controller at Gauge. “We really need to be doing higher level-analysis. That's what Maybern can offer–these efficiencies that will take us out of the weeds.” Maybern’s business model is to charge one to two basis points (0.01% to 0.02%) in fees for every $1 of assets that customers manage through its software. It has seven customers and about $17 billion in assets on its platform, implying annualized revenue of about $2 to $3 million. In addition to Gauge, Madison Realty Capital, a real estate-focused private equity and private credit firm with $21 billion in assets, also uses Maybern. Once firms have their data set up in Maybern and have automated accounting calculations, Mechanic wants to help them run more advanced analyses and make projections for different scenarios, such as what would happen to investor returns and cash holdings if a private equity firm sold an asset today versus holding it for two years. “That's where I see us going over time–from creating this automation layer that creates data governance, control and efficiency to more strategic decision-making for these funds.” Maybern has some daunting challenges in its path. First, it’s operating in a new category that funds haven’t historically bought software in, which will require a lot of legwork and education from the startup’s sales team. Companies like Yardi and FIS Private Capital (formerly Investran) have provided general ledger software for years, and other businesses like Juniper Square are well established in end-to-end fund accounting. But most companies have stopped short of running the painful calculations Maybern is specializing in, often requiring customers to do them on their own and upload them in Excel sheets. The complexity Maybern has plunged into creates another challenge–it must resist the temptation to do every little thing customers ask for, since that could cause it to morph into a labor-intensive consulting firm. “These funds have a ton of edge cases,” Mechanic says. “Finding the balance between handling those complexities while not building bespoke custom software is always the hardest part of this.” He tries to strike the balance by staying close to the market to understand the most pressing needs across many investment firms. “We need to make sure that, rather than solving an individual client's current problem, we're building functionality that also solves other pieces,” he says. “We also need to know when to say, ‘No, this is totally off-market and something you're going to have to do out of the system.’”",Forbes,Center,1325,"Center

134,The Media Lied To Create Biden’s ‘Decency’ Illusion. Biden Himself Exposed It.,"Who knew that fully restoring the soul of America would require Democrats to pardon a cocaine addict who cheated tax collectors and violated the party’s sacrosanct gun control laws? More than anything else, Joe Biden and the legacy media sold him for president in 2020 as the person who could make the nation decent again. It was corny every time he said he was running to “restore the soul of America,” but just as the manipulative news media manufactured pandemic hysteria and instigated violent race riots, they pushed the fiction that Biden would be the cure to make it all go away and re-instill principles, norms, and civility to our government. A month after the 2020 election, the New York Times editorial board wrote that Biden “won the presidency because, at a moment when so many Americans were exhausted by the chaos and nastiness of the Trump era, he promised stability, decency and healing.” The line was on repeat. “Joe’s Fearsome Weapon Against Trump: Simple Decency,” read a headline from as early as August 2020. “Decency will return to the White House, a fundamental moral shift,” NYT Opinion Columnist Roger Cohen wrote in December 2020. “[H]e represented the calm after the storm, the sense after the sensation,” read a piece from the same month by Frank Bruni. A personal favorite comes by way of Times columnist Bret Stephens, who still refers to himself as a conservative despite routinely rooting against Republicans in election after election. In August of 2020, Stephens proudly identified himself as a “Biden conservative” — it’s okay to laugh — and said that if nothing else, at least Biden was someone “who believed in loyalty and decency more than in any particular set of ideas.” It was all an attempt to get voters to believe that all of their problems — the pandemic, the riots, the conflict — would go away if they would only remove Donald Trump from office. America wasn’t ready for so much decency. After Inauguration, Biden set about throwing perfectly healthy patriots out of the military for declining Covid shots. Then he pressured companies to fire Americans who did the same. His Justice Department combed the country for harmless Jan. 6 protesters to harass them with lawfare and lock them in prison. Halfway into his tenure, Biden declared his political opponents “a threat to the very soul of this country.” Days before the 2024 election, he called Trump supporters “garbage.” Investigative efforts turned up overwhelming evidence that Hunter Biden had used his father’s high government rank to pull financial strings with foreign companies and officials. The goods indicated that Joe Biden knew about the business dealings, though he denied it. And when his son was finally in real legal jeopardy, Biden insisted he’d never interfere. What’s more, he was adamant that should his son be convicted of a crime, he wouldn’t issue him a pardon. Because no one is above the law, a concept as decent and civil as Biden. On Sunday, Biden told everyone he changed his mind. He said his Justice Department was actually corrupt for prosecuting his son after all. Biden went ahead and gifted his son a pardon covering all federal-level crimes, known and unknown, that took place over the course of more than a decade. Bret Stephens, the columnist at the Times who swore by Biden’s “decency,” called it “a degrading finale for Biden’s feeble, forgettable, frequently foolish presidency.” Neither Stephens nor any of his peers have a right to be offended. They dutifully assisted in the illusion that Biden was a good person full of only sweetness and light. It was a lie like nearly everything else they say. Biden is only in a position to do all of the sick and indecent things he did because of their own indecency.",Federalist,Right,634,"Right  
The article exhibits a strong conservative bias, criticizing Joe Biden and the media for allegedly creating a false narrative of him as a decent leader. It employs derogatory language, emphasizes negative portrayals of Biden's actions, and seeks to invalidate the media's role in promoting his image. The overall tone is confrontational against the left and supportive of a right-leaning viewpoint, particularly regarding the implications of Biden's presidency and rhetoric."
313,"Trump’s Defense pick, Pete Hegseth, faces new media report on alleged alcohol abuse, sexual impropriety","Pete Hegseth, the already embattled choice of President-elect Donald Trump to lead the Pentagon, faces a new magazine report detailing his alleged alcohol abuse, sexual impropriety, and mismanagement while he was running two veterans’ nonprofit groups. The report, published late Sunday by The New Yorker, citing a previously undisclosed whistleblower complaint written in 2015, said Hegseth was drunk on repeated occasions while acting as president of the Concerned Veterans for America “to the point of needing to be carried out of the organization’s events.” “At one point, Hegseth had to be restrained while drunk from joining the dancers on the stage of a Louisiana strip club, where he had brought his team,” The New Yorker reported, citing the whistleblower report, which the magazine said was compiled by several former CVA employees and sent to the group’s senior management. “The report also says that Hegseth, who was married at the time, and other members of his management team sexually pursued the organization’s female staffers, whom they divided into two groups — the ‘party girls’ and the ‘not party girls,’” The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer wrote. CNBC has not seen the whistleblower report nor a separate letter of complaint detailed by the magazine. Hegseth was forced to step down as president of CVA in 2016 in part due to “concerns about his mismanagement and abuse of alcohol on the job,” the magazine said, citing what it called three knowledgeable sources, one of whom contributed to the whistleblower report. The article says that another group that Hegseth previously led, Vets for Freedom, under his leadership “soon ran up enormous debt” and by the end of 2008 “was unable to pay its creditors.” The magazine reported that VFF’s finances “grew so dire that the group’s donors hatched a plan to take control away from Hegseth.” Hegseth’s job title was downgraded on annual tax filings by VFF, and his compensation was reduced, until he left by 2012, according to The New Yorker. CNBC has requested comment from Hegseth’s attorney, Timothy Parlatore, who earlier declined to comment to NBC News. The New Yorker quoted a statement provided to the magazine by Parlatore, who said it came from a person the attorney identified as an advisor to Hegseth. “We’re not going to comment on outlandish claims laundered through The New Yorker by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth’s,” that statement said. “Get back to us when you try your first attempt at actual journalism.” Trump’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC on The New Yorker article. Hegseth, a decorated U.S. military veteran who most recently worked as a host on Fox News, was tapped by Trump in November to be the next secretary of the Defense Department. His planned nomination almost immediately came under fire, after revelations that police in Monterey, California, investigated Hegseth for an alleged sexual assault of a woman in October 2017 at a hotel where a Republican women’s convention was being held. Hegseth, who told police he had consensual sex with the woman, was not criminally charged after that probe. He told reporters on Capitol Hill on Nov. 21: “As far as the media is concerned, I’ll keep this very simple. The matter was fully investigated and I was completely cleared, and that’s where I’m going to leave it.” At the time of the 2017 incident, Hegseth was in the midst of a divorce from his second wife. Two months before the alleged assault, his current wife, with whom he was involved in an extramarital relationship at the time, gave birth to a baby fathered by Hegseth. The Monterey County district attorney in a statement in late November said her office declined to file criminal charges against Hegseth in January 2018 because “no charges were supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” Several years after the alleged incident, Hegseth paid the woman an undisclosed sum of money “as part of a civil confidential settlement and maintains his innocence,” Parlatore said in mid-November. Hegseth’s attorney told NBC News at the time that Hegseth “ultimately decided to enter into a settlement for a significantly reduced amount” at the “height of the MeToo movement.” The police report on the sexual assault probe, which was made public in November, said investigators spoke with a hotel worker who saw Hegseth and the accuser at a pool after two separate guests complained of a loud disturbance. The worker “stated Hegseth was very intoxicated” and that the woman he was with “was not intoxicated ... and was very coherent,” the police report said. However, the woman later told police that she was unable to recall much of what happened when she went with Hegseth to his room. She “believes something might have been slipped into her drink, as she cannot remember most of the night’s events,” police wrote in their report. Correction: Pete Hegseth was previously president of the Concerned Veterans for America nonprofit group. An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the group.",CNBC,Center,838,"Lean Left  
The article presents detailed allegations against Pete Hegseth, including alcohol abuse and sexual impropriety, which tend to reflect a critical stance towards him and, by extension, the Trump administration. The sourcing from publications like The New Yorker, known for a left-leaning standpoint, combined with the focus on negative aspects of Hegseth's character, suggests a bias that resonates more with left-leaning media perspectives."
267,Trump threatens 100% tariff on the BRIC bloc of nations if they act to undermine U.S. dollar,"President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday threatened 100% tariffs against a bloc of nine nations if they act to undermine the U.S. dollar. His threat was directed at countries in the so-called BRIC alliance, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have applied to become members and several other countries have expressed interest in joining. While the U.S. dollar is by far the most-used currency in global business and has survived past challenges to its preeminence, members of the alliance and other developing nations say they are fed up with America’s dominance of the global financial system. The dollar represents roughly 58% of the world’s foreign exchange reserves, according to the IMF and major commodities like oil are still primarily bought and sold using dollars. The dollar’s dominance is threatened, however, with BRICS’ growing share of GDP and the alliance’s intent to trade in non-dollar currencies — a process known as de-dollarization. Trump, in a Truth Social post, said: “We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy.” At a summit of BRIC nations in October, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the U.S. of “weaponizing” the dollar and described it as a “big mistake.” “It’s not us who refuse to use the dollar,” Putin said at the time. “But if they don’t let us work, what can we do? We are forced to search for alternatives.” Russia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network, SWIFT, and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. Trump said there is “no chance” BRIC will replace the U.S. dollar in global trade and any country that tries to make that happen “should wave goodbye to America.” Research shows that the U.S. dollar’s role as the primary global reserve currency is not threatened in the near future. An Atlantic Council model that assesses the dollar’s place as the primary global reserve currency states the dollar is “secure in the near and medium term” and continues to dominate other currencies. Trump’s latest tariff threat comes after he threatened to slap 25% tariffs on everything imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tax on goods from China, as a way to force the countries to do more to halt the flow of illegal immigration and drugs into the U.S. He has since held a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who said Thursday she is confident that a tariff war with the United States can be averted.

280,Hong Kong-Listed Property Manager ESR Group Gets $7 Billion Take-Private Offer,"ESR Group, Asia’s largest real estate fund manager by asset under management, has received an offer from a consortium including U.S. private equity giants Starwood Capital Group and Warburg Pincus to take the Hong Kong-listed firm private. ESR said on Wednesday the consortium proposed HK$13 per share to acquire about 60% of the firm it does not already own. The proposed deal, which values ESR at HK$55.2 billion ($7.1 billion), will be the largest privatization from the Hong Kong stock exchange since 2021 if successful, according to a joint statement. The offer represents a premium of 55.7% over its closing price of HK$8.35 on April 24, the day prior to the consortium’s submission of a non-binding offer, ESR said. Shares of ESR rose about 3.3% to HK$11.82 on Thursday after they resumed trading. The consortium is led by Starwood Capital Group and U.S. investment firms Sixth Street and SSW Partners, according to the statement. Joining the group also includes Warburg Pincus, sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority, as well as ESR’s cofounders Jeffery Shen, Stuart Gibson and Charles Portes. The offer allows ESR shareholders to receive cash, roll their shares into the future private company, or a combination of both. The consortium said it had received support from shareholders not involved in the buyout representing more than 51% of the shares as of Wednesday. The group said in the statement ESR “needs to transition to an asset-light platform, refocus on new economy sectors, simplify its current portfolio with non-core asset divestitures, realize cost synergies and optimize its balance sheet.” It added that a privatization would therefore be best to allow a more flexible execution and to avoid short-term earnings fluctuations. ESR said it’s the largest real estate investment manager in Asia, with an AUM of $154 billion as of June. The firm owns and manages 50 million square meters of properties, which focus mainly on sectors such as logistics and data centers, across 28 countries worldwide.

114,Biden Laments America’s ‘Original Sin’ of Slavery in Angola,"President Joe Biden toured the National Museum of Slavery in Angola’s capital of Luanda on Tuesday, delivering a speech in which he described slavery as America’s “original sin” and claiming it still taints American public discourse. “The United States is founded on an idea, one embedded in our Declaration of Independence, that all men and women are created equal. It is abundantly clear today we have not lived up to that idea, but we have not fully walked away from it either,” Biden said. Biden said slavery was “cruel, brutal, dehumanizing,” an “original sin” that “haunted America and cast a long shadow ever since.” NBC News noted that Biden gave his speech in the “shadow” of the former chapel at a onetime slavery annex, “where Africans were forced into Christian baptism before they were loaded onto ships to become part of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.” WATCH — Joe Biden Lands in Angola Shortly After Pardoning Hunter Biden: “It’s believed that the first enslaved Africans to reach the 13 British colonies in 1619 were from what is now Angola,” NBC added. Students of the history of slavery say that up to a quarter of the slaves sent to America passed through the region that is now Angola. The audience for Biden’s speech on slavery included Wanda and Vincent Tucker, who are descended from two of the first slaves brought from Angola to colonial Virginia in 1619. “It’s incredibly awesome to have the president of the United States to come to the homeland where the first enslaved people were taken from,” Wanda Tucker said in an interview outside the National Museum of Slavery. “It’s even more important because we have to keep the history and the story going wherever there are opportunities to tell the story,” she added. Much of Biden’s speech was built on his favored talking point that American conservatives are supposedly eager to forget about slavery and ban teachers from talking about it. “I have learned that while history can be hidden, it cannot and should not be erased. It should be faced. It’s our duty to face our history – the good, the bad and the ugly, the whole truth. That’s what great nations do,” Biden said in his speech. The bitterest irony is that few Western leaders have done more to bring slavery back into vogue than Joe Biden. His open-borders policies have triggered an explosion in human trafficking, as even his own administration officials admit. This includes the sexual trafficking of children, which is unquestionably a form of slavery. Young victims trafficked under Joe Biden say they have been mentally and physically tortured to compel their obedience, including heavy doses of drugs plus medieval torments, such as having their fingernails pulled out. A whistleblower at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said in November 2024 that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris created a “white-glove delivery service” for putting migrant children into the hands of traffickers and drug cartels. “Today, as we speak, children are preparing to work grueling overnight shifts in slaughterhouses, restaurants, and factories. Some children may die today in jobs they don’t have the knowledge or skills to do in order to repay never-ending debts to their smugglers and traffickers,” said whistleblower Tara Lee Rodas. The House Judiciary Committee published a report in November that said foreign nationals linked to human trafficking have used the Biden-Harris “parole pipeline” for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to move freely across the border. The parole pipeline, formally known as the CHNV program, is a bureaucratic fiction created by the Biden administration to keep the number of migrant encounters with the Border Patrol down, masking the severity of the border crisis. According to House Judiciary, the system proved very useful to sex traffickers, who submitted a large number of fraudulent applications from suspicious Internet addresses, the vast majority of them for young women. President Biden appeared very well-versed on the events of 1619 while touring Angola. It is a pity he did not focus more on the events of 2021-2024 while he was in charge of stopping modern-day slavery across the southern border.",Breitbart,Right,688,"Lean Right

371,The Great American Acid Trip,"In 1966, the poet Allen Ginsberg offered a remedy for America’s broken soul: If everyone tried LSD, he said, we would discover “some ray of glory or vastness beyond our conditioned social selves, beyond our government, beyond America even, that will unite us into a peaceful community.” Psychedelics, in other words, could save America.More than half a century later, the nation’s psychedelic movement finds itself with a new figurehead: Rick Doblin. As the founder of the nonprofit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), Doblin has spent decades pushing for the liberalization of access to psychedelics—drugs he believes can cure the world of trauma and usher in a new golden age. His goal, he says, is to create “a world of net-zero trauma by 2070.” Doblin is about to have a new, powerful ally in his quest. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—the man charged by Donald Trump with “Making America Healthy Again”—is a big believer in the power of psychedelics. He endorsed legalizing them during his presidential campaign. Kennedy sees psychedelic drugs as one of the tools of healing that Big Pharma has tried to keep away from the public—part of a broader alternative medicine agenda. In a recent post on X, the nominee for the nation’s top health post published a list of drugs and therapies he plans to liberate from FDA “suppression.” The first item was psychedelics.

295,Biden looks to stop paying workers with disabilities less than minimum wage,"Simone Del Rosario: Did you know there are tens of thousands of U.S. workers legally being paid less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour? It comes from a Depression-era policy that allows qualified employers to hire workers with disabilities at a subminimum wage. 14(c) certificates are given to employers to prevent limiting job opportunities for these workers. But the Biden administration believes this is no longer needed and wants to phase it out. The proposed rule from the Labor Department would immediately stop issuing new 14(c) certificates, and for those employers currently paying subminimum wages, there would be a 3-year phase out period. The public comment period on this proposed rule stretches to Jan. 17, 2025, three days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. It would be up to the Trump administration to review the comments, issue a final rule or withdraw it and keep the program the same. The practice is dwindling on its own. Department of Labor data shows that since 2001, the number of workers legally being paid this subminimum wage has gone down 90%, from more than 400,000 to 40,000. Pushing that decline is the fact that 15 states have already outlawed or are in the process of phasing out 14(c) certificates. That’s according to data compiled by the Association of People Supporting Employment First. For the approximately 40,000 workers getting paid less than minimum wage, the Labor Department says 91% have intellectual or developmental disabilities. Ninety-three percent of them work for community rehabilitation programs, local community organizations that work with adults with disabilities. The Labor Department says the median hourly wage is $3.46, less than half the federal minimum wage. About half the workers make less than $3.50 an hour. About 10% make less than $1 per hour.",SAN,Center,296,"Left  
This article supports the Biden administration's efforts to eliminate a policy that allows workers with disabilities to be paid less than the minimum wage.

The focus on improving conditions for workers with disabilities reflects a left-leaning perspective concerned about income inequality and social justice. The inclusion of statistics also aims to highlight the urgency of the issue, further reinforcing a left-of-center narrative."
207,Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau Meets With Trump in Florida Amid Tariffs Threat,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau flew to Florida on Friday to have dinner with President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club after Trump threatened to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if they don’t stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders. A person familiar with the details called it a ""positive wide-ranging dinner that lasted three hours.” The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said topics included trade, border security, fentanyl, defense, Ukraine, NATO, China and pipelines, as well as the the Group of Seven meeting in Canada next year. Although Trump once called Trudeau “weak” and “dishonest” during his first term, ties between the two countries have remained among the closest in the world. Trudeau is the first leader from the G7 countries to visit Trump since the Nov. 5 election. Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump's pick to lead the Interior Department, Mike Waltz, Trump's choice to be his national security adviser, and the three men's wives. Also at the dinner were David McCormick, just elected U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, and his wife, Dina Powell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump, as well as Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, whose responsibilities include border security, and Katie Telford, Trudeau's chief of staff. McCormick posted a photo on X of the group seated at a round table on the patio of Mar-a-Lago. At the table behind the president-elect a boy can be seen mugging for the camera. Trump’s transition did not respond to questions about what they had discussed or whether the conversation alleviated Trump’s concerns about the border. A smiling Trudeau declined comment upon returning to his West Palm Beach hotel late Friday. Trudeau said earlier Friday that he would resolve the tariffs issue by talking to Trump. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday after speaking with Trump that she is confident a tariff war with the United States will be averted. “We’re going to work together to meet some of the concerns,” Trudeau told reporters in Prince Edward Island in Atlantic Canada. “But ultimately it is through lots of real constructive conversations with President Trump that I am going to have, that will keep us moving forward on the right track for all Canadians.” Trudeau said Trump got elected because he promised to bring down the cost of groceries but now he's talking about adding 25% to the cost of all kinds of products including potatoes from Prince Edward Island. “It is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There’s no question about it,” Trudeau said. “Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would actually be raising prices for Americans citizens as well and hurting American industry and business,” he added. Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump’s team negotiated during his initial term. Trudeau noted they were able to successfully re-negotiate the deal, which he calls a “win win” for both countries. “We can work together as we did previously,” Trudeau said. Trump made the tariff threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though the numbers at the Canadian border pale in comparison to the southern border. The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone — and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024. Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border are few in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security. Trudeau called Trump after he made his social media posts on the border. When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Canada is already examining possible retaliatory tariffs on certain items from the U.S. should Trump follow through on his threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, a senior official told The Associated Press this week. A government official said Canada is preparing for every eventuality and has started thinking about what items to target with tariffs in retaliation. The official stressed no decision has been made. The person spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. “Canada has reason to fear because Trump is impulsive, often influenced by the last thing he sees on Fox News,” said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. “He can leverage that by catering to what he thinks will sound and look good to the public rather than to what happens or will happen.”",TIME,Lean Left,1016,"Lean Left  
The article presents facts regarding the meeting between Trudeau and Trump while also highlighting concerns about Trump's tariff threats, which could harm both Canadian and American citizens. The use of quotes from Trudeau and an academic voice criticizing Trump supports a more critical perspective towards Trump's policies, indicative of a slight left-leaning bias. The focus on the potential negative impacts of Trump's actions further emphasizes this stance."

265,Here’s How Much Cash Donald Trump Spends Each Year,"What does it cost to live like a king? Ask Donald Trump. Bank records released in the former president’s fraud trial, which he lost earlier this year and is now appealing, suggest that the real estate mogul spends about $1 million a month on personal expenses. But that’s just the start of it. Trump also has an empire to protect—properties to buy, developments to create, debt to service and litigation to settle. Add everything up, and Trump burned through more than $130 million a year on average, or $11 million a month, from 2010 through the first half of 2019, according to bank records. His expenses varied wildly by year, exceeding $200 million before he ran for president the first time, then dropping to about $60 million once he settled into the White House. Now one month away from reclaiming his throne, Trump is at a crossroads, with little clarity on how much cash he will need over the next four years. To understand how Trump arrived at this moment, it helps to go back to the Great Recession, when cash was tight for almost everyone. The crisis hit Trump hard at projects in Chicago and Las Vegas. But he had an advantage that other developers did not. The Apprentice, which started in 2004, provided both entertainment income and licensing opportunities. By 2010, Trump earned nearly $50 million a year from those sources, even more than he took in from his buildings. So while other developers pinched pennies, Trump spent big. He shelled out $37 million to upgrade his aircraft in 2010, purchasing a Boeing 757 and customizing it to his liking. It was his biggest cash outlay of the year, accounting for more than one-third of his total $101 million in spending. Shortly thereafter, Trump doled out another $25 million for a helicopter, with the idea that it could ferry people a few miles between Miami’s airport and his new golf resort, Trump National Doral. He used some cash more responsibly, purchasing a $130 million note against his tower in Chicago for $48 million, then paying down another loan in Las Vegas. Cleaning up his balance sheet required $75 million of liquidity over the 12-month period ending June 30, 2012, his biggest cash expense in a year when he burned $203 million. Then he went on a building binge. From mid-2012 to mid-2016, Trump blew through $600 million of cash on acquisitions and property development, about 80% of the money flying out his door. He redeveloped the Miami golf resort and purchased two others in Europe. He also transformed Washington D.C.’s Old Post Office into the Trump International Hotel. To top it off, he spent about $65 million on his presidential campaign. Building a political movement turned out to be cheaper than building a real estate empire. In the White House, Trump’s development expenses decreased by more than $100 million a year. But politics came with other costs. In 2016, shortly after winning the election, Trump agreed to a $25 million settlement to resolve litigation surrounding Trump University, a blow that led him to take out a secret loan around the time of his first inauguration. Trump’s cash expenses fell to $83 million in the year ending June 30, 2018, their lowest level since at least 2012, then dropped another 30% to about $60 million the following year, according to the records. Eventually, most of his cash outlays went toward propping up various ventures, as both the D.C. hotel and the European courses strained to turn a profit. Losses multiplied when Covid-19 landed in 2020. “I wouldn’t say you’re thriving when you decide to close down your hotels and your businesses,” Trump told a crowd of reporters inside the White House briefing room. But the problems went away almost as suddenly as they appeared. Trump sold his money-losing hotel for a reported $375 million in 2022, handing the headache to other investors (who failed to meet their debt obligations and ended up losing control of the property). Trump’s golf business, meanwhile, thrived as the world healed from the pandemic. Donors kept pouring money into Trump’s political groups, saving him from having to put more of his own cash into his 2024 presidential run. He even got other people to finance his new social-media business. A spokesperson for the president-elect, Steven Cheung, ignored a set of specific inquiries related to this story and instead issued a statement touting his boss. ""President Trump is one of the most successful businessmen in history and then became president of the United States,” he said. “He has built historic and widely recognized properties that redefined the New York skyline and has created award-winning golf courses around the world."" On the cusp of returning to the White House, Trump’s finds himself facing an unpredictable financial position. The operations of the Trump Organization are in good shape, leaner and more profitable than during his first term. With fewer weaknesses in his empire, Trump might be able to deploy less than $50 million of cash in 2025, which would make the coming year one of his cheapest in recent memory. But that’s assuming everything goes his way, which it might not. On July 6, 2025, a $117 million loan comes due against one of Trump’s New York City properties. The president-elect, who still has not refinanced the debt, might have to dip into his own pocket to pay back his lender. Legal troubles are also looming—Trump owes a total of $578 million, including interest, stemming from three court cases, all currently under appeal. Losses could leave Trump’s underlings scrambling to sell or refinance assets while he serves as president.",Forbes,Center,942,"Lean Right

181,"Musk, Ramaswamy eyeing federal remote work policies to help slash $2T from budget","Work from home policies came under fire from X and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, as he and Republican businessman Vivek Ramaswamy took their plans to reduce government waste to the floors of Congress Thursday. The businessmen, who were selected by President-elect Donald Trump to lead an outside advisory board called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), attended several closed-door meetings with GOP senators and House members to sell their plans to cut as much as $2 trillion from the federal budget of what they called waste. ""I think we should make sure we spend the public’s money well,"" Musk told reporters between the meetings. Musk posted on his social media platform X from inside the Capitol about what he and Ramaswamy say is a key issue for DOGE: The number of federal employees working from home. The Federal Office of Management and Budget released a report in August that found “as of May 2024, approximately 50% of federal workers worked every day in roles that are not eligible for telework, including those who work onsite providing healthcare to our veterans, inspecting our food supply, and managing Federal natural resources."" Musk shared a new report from Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, the chair of the Senate DOGE caucus, which claimed only 6% of federal workers show up in person to work on a full-time basis. Many others work from home part-time, and roughly one-third work from home full-time, according to the report. ""If you exclude security guards & maintenance personnel, the number of government workers who show up in person and do 40 hours of work a week is closer to 1%! Almost no one,"" Musk posted in response to the report. Ernst’s report includes several anecdotes and alleged social media posts about federal employees who worked from home, including a Department of Veterans Affairs manager who posted a photo of himself working from a bathtub. Ernst’s team included the photo in their report. The OMB report found that ""telework-eligible personnel spent approximately 60% of regular, working hours inperson, at agency-assigned job sites.” Musk has been a staunch opponent of work-from-home policies and removed such policies from his businesses, including X. He threatened layoffs for X employees who did not comply with his policy, which instructed any special requests for remote work needed to be reviewed by him before approval.",ABC,Lean Left,388,"Lean Right

374,"Judge in Trans Whistleblower Case Defers Prosecution’s Gag Order Request, Delays Trial","Houston, Texas — A federal judge has delayed the Department of Justice’s criminal trial against Dr. Eithan Haim until February, two months after it was set to begin. Haim is the surgeon-turned-whistleblower who exposed Texas Children’s Hospital (TCH) last year for continuing to transition minors after hospital leadership announced it would shut down the transgender medical program. U.S. District judge David Hittner scheduled the final pre-trial conference for February 6 and jury selection for February 10, with the trial most likely starting the latter date presuming all jurors are selected. The Reagan-appointed judge ruled that he would continue the hearing without prejudice, meaning the trial is postponed. The decision came Tuesday afternoon during a motion hearing in which Hittner was considering the government’s motion for a gag order against the defendant and his attorneys. Hittner deferred the gag order at this time, but the judge said he “will not hesitate” to reconsider one. Hittner noted he has never issued a gag order in his decades-long career as a federal judge. The DOJ wanted to silence Haim and his legal team, keeping them from taking to social media to criticize the federal prosecutors and complain about what they see as an unfair case. The prosecutors claimed the sheer volume of the social-media posts constituted “online bullying” and demonstrated “inflammatory language,” while the defense lawyers cited Haim’s First Amendment rights in arguing that he can post about the legal proceedings. Haim’s lawyers, who filed a renewed motion to dismiss the case entirely, declined to immediately comment about the outcome of the motion hearing. Attorney Marcella Burke later told National Review: “We feel very confident that Dr. Haim will be vindicated.” The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas could not be reached for comment.

347,"South Korean President to Reverse Martial-Law Declaration after Parliamentary Opposition, Mass Protests","Under enormous pressure, South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol said he will reverse his decision to impose martial law following mass parliamentary opposition and sustained protests early Wednesday morning in Seoul. Yoon declared martial law Tuesday and banned “all political activities” in the southeast Asian nation, setting off shockwaves around the world and prompting an immediate vote to reverse the order from members of parliament. Yoon delivered an address announcing his declaration of martial law to root out purported North Korean forces and sidestep legislative gridlock from political opposition that he likened to a dictatorship, the Korea Times reported. “Dear citizens, I declare emergency martial law to defend the free Republic of Korea from the threats of North Korean communist forces and to eradicate the shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people and to protect the free constitutional order,” Yoon said. Yoon did not specify the North Korean activities he was referring to. His declaration has been roundly condemned, including by his predecessor Moon Jae-in of the progressive Democratic Party. “I hope that the National Assembly will act quickly to protect our democracy from crumbling,” he said on X. It marked the first time martial law had been declared in South Korea since 1980, prior to the country becoming a full-fledged democracy. South Korea is universally considered a democratic nation and it was initially unclear how its institutions will hold up. Protests started outside the South Korean parliament shortly after Yoon’s announcement as lawmakers sought to quickly end what appeared to be a consolidation of power by the president. Some protesters could be seen shouting “withdraw emergency martial law!” and calling to arrest Yoon for the declaration. Police and soldiers went to the parliamentary building in Seoul to prevent protesters from entering, with clashes playing out on live television and videos circulating widely on social media. The National Assembly convened for an emergency session to vote for a resolution to lift the martial-law declaration as elected officials tried to figure out the appropriate response. National Assembly speaker Woo Son-shik deemed Yoon’s martial law declaration “null and void” after the assembly vote and demanded soldiers and police leave the assembly area. Yoon was first elected president narrowly in 2022 on a conservative platform of increased hostility to North Korea and closer ties to the U.S., a longtime ally of South Korea. He has attempted to crack down on “disinformation” by going after news organizations and journalists. Much of Yoon’s tenure has been defined by conflict with political opposition who remain in control of parliament. The South Korean constitution gives the president the authority to declare martial law in wartime situations and other war-like emergencies. Parliament can lift martial-law declarations with a majority vote, a threshold parliament cleared easily with a unanimous vote. Yoon appointed general Park An-Su martial law commander to ban “all political activities” and give the state control over all news media. Violators of the general’s martial law decree can be arrested without a warrant. Parliamentary activities and political party behavior fall under the martial law decree. Han Dong-hoon, the leader of Yoon’s People Power Party, voiced opposition to martial law and vowed to “block it” from taking place, South Korean media reported.

326,Martin Gurri: Our Countercultural Revolution,"Some presidential elections are decided by tactical moves: a stronger ground game to get out the vote, for example, or by superior media messaging. Donald Trump’s sweeping victory over Kamala Harris was none of those things. It was strategic and epochal—far beyond the reach of mere maneuvering by Harris or her team. On November 5, a strange patchwork coalition, with scant resemblance to the traditional Republican Party, overwhelmed the massed institutional forces of the progressive establishment and the Democratic Party. That misfit coalition won not just the White House, but the Senate and the House. Votes are still being counted as I write this, but the consequences will be social and cultural as much as they are political.Speculation has centered on what, beyond the obvious partisan reversal, actually transpired at the polls. Was it the triumph, long foretold, of digital over traditional media? Of restless young bros over scolding cat ladies? Of outraged “normies” over our arrogant and out-of-touch elites? In my view, it was all of that plus one crucial thing more: the improbable elevation of Trump from the carnival barker of our politics to the leader of a potent cultural movement that is set to reshape many aspects of American life. The Collapse of Old MediaThe campaign saw the news media, as an institution, take a giant leap toward irrelevance—and ultimate extinction. From The New York Times to CBS News, the grand old brands of the industry gambled what shreds of trust remained in them—31 percent by one measure—to exert influence on behalf of Democratic candidates and progressive positions.

123,Jury Unable to Reach Verdict in Daniel Penny Case,"The jury at Daniel Penny's trial in the subway chokehold death of Jordan Neely said Friday that it is unable to reach a verdict on the more serious charge of second-degree manslaughter in the incident. The panel sent a note to the judge Friday morning to report that it is having trouble reaching a consensus that Penny ""recklessly"" caused Neely to die when he held him in a chokehold for six minutes after the homeless man reportedly shouted threats at passengers on the train, reports The New York Post. The court has not declared the jury as being hung. Penny's attorneys moved for a mistrial, pointing out that the jury is locked after it had deliberated for 20 hours over four days in a case that is not complex factually. The judge, however, rejected that motion, ordering the jury instead to try to reach a consensus. According to reports, the jury is not permitted to consider a second charge, criminally negligent homicide, if it has not reached a unanimous decision the charge of manslaughter. The judge also said a new trial may be needed on the second charge if the jury can't reach an agreement on the main charge. According to witnesses, Neely had yelled out that ""someone's going to die today!"" on the subway, but prosecutors stressed that no witness testified that Neely had brandished a weapon, touched any passengers, or threatened any specific person. They also pointed out that Neely was unarmed, and that police found that he only had a muffin in his pocket. Penny's attorneys argued that the prosecution could not prove that the chokehold killed Neely. The jury could also convict Penny on a lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide. He faces up to 15 years in prison if he's convicted of manslaughter, or up to four years if he's convicted on the charge of criminally negligent homicide.

214,7 charts and maps show where Harris underperformed and lost the election,"Turnout for the presidential election is not yet final, but it’s clear that fewer people voted in 2024 compared with 2020. Comparing the two elections, Donald Trump added about 2.8 million votes to his total in his 2024 victory. Vice President Kamala Harris, on the other hand, underperformed by about 6.8 million votes compared with Joe Biden in 2020, according to CNN election results as of November 25. Here are seven charts and maps that explain how the US popular vote, turnout in individual states and ultimately turnout in the seven key battleground states – where electoral votes were up for grabs – tell the story of Harris’ loss. This year will end up being one of just two elections in the 21st century in which the Republican presidential candidate got more votes than the Democratic candidate. It is also one of only two times in the 21st century that the number of votes cast dropped compared with the previous presidential election. The other came in 2012, when about 2.2 million fewer votes were cast than in 2008. Another way to look at Trump’s narrow edge in the popular vote is that he got the vote of about a third of the citizen voting-age population. A slightly smaller portion backed Harris. Another third did not vote at all. While Democrats’ portion of the vote has been up and down in recent elections, Trump has won more votes in each of the elections in which he was a candidate. Viewed in raw numbers, he got about 63 million votes in 2016, 74 million in 2020 and nearly 77 million in 2024. The difference for Democrats was that turnout surged in 2020, the pandemic election. Harris got fewer votes than Biden in 45 of the 50 states and Washington, DC. While votes are still being added to the totals in some states, changes at this point would be marginal. Most of Harris’ drop-off came in populous states like California, New York and Florida, where a dip in support for Harris did not affect the Electoral College vote tally. Trump boosted his overall count in those population centers as well, padding his count by hundreds of thousands of votes in Texas, Florida and New York and to a lesser extent in traditional Democratic strongholds like New Jersey and Massachusetts. Zooming in on the hotly contested battleground states where the election was much closer, Harris and Trump both gained votes compared with 2020 in Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada. The population has also grown in all of those states in the past four years. Arizona’s population has also grown, though the total number of votes cast in the state held about even. Harris got fewer votes there compared with Biden in 2020, and Trump carried it with his largest margin of victory across the seven battlegrounds. Pennsylvania and Michigan are battleground states where the population has not grown in the past four years and where Harris got fewer votes in 2024 than Biden got in 2020. Democrats lamenting the results have pointed out that the election was decided by about 230,000 votes in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, battleground states won narrowly by Trump. But Harris lost votes compared with Biden across the country. Harris’ losses compared with Biden were biggest in Southern California, southern Florida and in the Northeast. The few places where Harris got more votes than Biden were largely concentrated in those seven battleground states, in particular Georgia and North Carolina, but it wasn’t enough to overcome Trump’s gains. The only state where Harris gained votes on Biden’s 2020 performance, that was not also a battleground state, was Utah. Trump made gains across the seven battleground states in particular, but they weren’t limited to places with higher turnout.

243,Donald Trump’s incoming team met with Ukraine officials,"(NewsNation) — Donald Trump’s incoming team is holding talks with Ukrainian officials about ending the war with Russia, all in a bid to help resolve the conflict prior to the president-elect taking office. Several people in Trump’s future administration, including Vice President-elect JD Vance, have met with leaders from Ukraine in Washington and Florida, reported The Wall Street Journal. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s pick as a special envoy for the conflict, and his soon-to-be national security adviser, Mike Waltz, were also part of the meetings. Trump has been clear about wanting to end the nearly three-year-long war both while campaigning and after securing the presidential win. Putin lowers the threshold for using his nuclear arsenal after Biden’s arms decision for Ukraine A key strategy to wind down the war appears to be getting both sides to the negotiating table as quickly as possible, potentially through diplomatic coercion. This would involve siphoning off aid to Ukraine if they refuse to come to the table, and if Russia refuses, assistance could be ramped up. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with Trump soon after his electoral victory and has said that he would consider effectively ceding some territory to Russia in exchange for NATO protection of parts of the country Ukraine controls. The issue will be the biggest hurdle in resolving the conflict, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has been adamantly against Ukraine’s inclusion into NATO and has used the possibility to justify the war in Ukraine. Trump set to inherit ongoing conflicts in Israel, Ukraine Trump’s team has not been open to committing to NATO membership for the Ukrainians, which may further complicate negotiations. Last month, Putin approved budget plans raising 2025 military spending to record levels as Moscow seeks to prevail in the war in Ukraine. Nuclear fears are also growing after Putin confirmed the use of a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile in Ukraine, warning the West that U.S. air defenses would be powerless against it.",NewsNaiton,Center,323,"Center

238,Trans people traveled to the Supreme Court from across the U.S. to hear historic case,"WASHINGTON — Dozens of transgender people, along with their families and allies, gathered outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday as the justices considered a Tennessee law banning access to puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans minors. Some of them, like Lisa and Ryan Welch, traveled hundreds of miles to be in Washington. The Welches, who live in Indianapolis, have a 17-year-old trans son and are the plaintiffs in a suit against a similar law in Indiana. “We absolutely know that this care saved our son’s life,” Lisa said through tears. “He didn’t think he had a future. He didn’t plan for anything, because he didn’t think he was going to be a boy, and he didn’t think he was going to be around.” Ryan said that before their son received transition-related care, he struggled with suicidal ideation and anxiety. Now, after having gotten care, he’s preparing to go to art school. Lisa said, “To see that light return to his eyes, I’m never going to stop fighting.” Ryan said that with Indiana’s restriction in effect, they have to drive their son about three hours to Chicago every three to six months for appointments and over the border to another part of Illinois about once a month to pick up testosterone. The stakes of the high court’s decision in United States v. Skrmetti are high for the Welch family and many others who were gathered both inside and outside the court Wednesday. The central issue the justices are considering is whether Tennessee’s law discriminates on the basis of sex. If the court says it does, the law would be subject to a stricter level of constitutional review that would be difficult to meet. If the court rules it doesn’t, then Tennessee’s law and similar restrictions in 25 other states would most likely stand. A decision against the sex-discrimination claim would also undermine a key argument against a similar policy proposal from President-elect Donald Trump to restrict transition-related care for minors and adults at the federal level. The questions the majority conservative court asked during oral arguments appeared to suggest that the justices didn’t quite buy that the law discriminates based on sex, with some of them appearing to favor the state’s argument that it restricts care based on its medical purpose. Many of those who showed up outside the court Wednesday said they wanted to show their support for the trans teens and a doctor who sued Tennessee. Kaleb Todd, 27, said that he has a personal connection to the decision both because he is a trans man and because he and his wife chose to move from Texas to Philadelphia in April because they want to start a family soon and they fear Texas’ policies regarding women, educators and trans people. Todd, an engineer, said he also showed up outside the court in the chilly temperatures to send a message to the court itself. “I think it’s important to remind people who get to make these decisions that we’re here and we’re beautiful and we know what’s best for ourselves,” Todd said. Vienna Cavazos, who is 18 and uses they/them pronouns, traveled from Delaware because, they said, the “monumental case is extremely important, not only to me and my family,” but also in their work crafting pro-LGBTQ policy in Delaware. Like Todd, Cavazos is from Texas. Their family moved in 2022 following an executive order from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in February that called on citizens to report parents to the state’s Child Protective Services agency if they provided transition-related care to their minor children. Cavazos said that they planned to begin receiving such care but that “it was either we wait until I turn 18 or leave Texas. We were fortunate enough to have the resources available to leave.” Cavazos said the high court will have blood on its hands if it allows Tennessee’s law to stand. If it doesn’t, “we’re still fighting.” “Trans people are not going anywhere,” they said. “We’re going to seek the health care whether it’s legal or not.” Devon Yates, who traveled from New York City and camped outside the court starting at 11 a.m. Tuesday to get a seat inside, described the oral arguments as “horrible.” “They’re going to roll back the clock, that’s what it looks like,” he said. Yates said he wanted to attend oral arguments “because I support the trans community.” “This is f------ hate,” he said of Tennessee’s law. A smaller group of counterprotesters organized by Do No Harm, a conservative medical policy group, also gathered outside the court Wednesday with signs that featured sayings including “Sex change is fantasy,” “Puberty blockers = Anti-Gay” and “kids don’t need gender clinics.” Matt Sharp, an attorney with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group, said he was encouraged to hear what the Supreme Court had to say “in this developing area of science.” Multiple justices mentioned some European countries’ restricting access to transition-related care for minors, though none have completely banned it. “When Europe and other countries are reversing course, the United States, rather than challenging Tennessee, ought to respect the authority of Tennessee lawmakers as they looked at the science and decided there’s a better course of action for Tennessee’s kids,” Sharp said. “Rather than putting them on a medicalized path, we can get them counseling and psychotherapy. We can let them have a natural childhood, let them naturally develop and put science above ideology and put truth above lies.” Some of the rally attendees waved flags and held signs defiantly next to or in front of supporters of Tennessee’s law. Nadine Seiler, 59, a T-shirt designer and self-described “rabble rouser” from Waldorf, Maryland, waved a large trans flag with “Black trans lives matter” written on it. She said the flag came from the Black Lives Matter Memorial fence that was erected along a section of the chain link fence outside the White House in 2020. She said she traveled to the court to show solidarity with marginalized groups, including the trans community, “who are going to be affected by Project 2025,” a conservative policy road map that Democrats linked to the Trump campaign, which repeatedly distanced itself from the project. “This is just the beginning, and I am very concerned for everybody in marginalized groups,” she said.",NBC,Lean Left,1051,"Left

151,‘100 Percent Bullsh-t’: Fox News Talent Shoot Down NBC’s Smear Campaign Against Pete Hegseth,"Current and former Fox News talent are calling bull on legacy media’s latest smear campaign to sink Pete Hegseth’s bid to lead the Pentagon. On Tuesday, NBC News dropped a malicious hit piece against the Army veteran and former “Fox and Friends Weekend” host, in which 10 allegedly former and current network employees supposedly claimed that Hegseth displayed signs of a drinking problem in the workplace. Curiously, none of the alleged anonymous sources referenced by authors Chloe Melas, Courtney Kube, and Sarah Fitzpatrick identified themselves, citing “fear of retaliation.” The left-wing outlet’s trafficking of slanderous and unsubstantiated claims of wrongdoing by Hegseth bears a striking resemblance to the smear tactics deployed by media hacktivists in their bid to defeat Brett Kavanaugh’s 2018 Supreme Court nomination. Lacking any journalistic integrity, these so-called “reporters” ran with any and all claims laundered by the judge’s accusers with virtually no pushback or skepticism. The publication of Tuesday’s hit piece received immediate pushback from Hegseth’s former Fox colleagues and network contributors and guests, who all shot down the allegations of unprofessional workplace conduct. On X, “Fox and Friends Weekend” co-host Will Cain called NBC’s story, “Bullsh-t. 100 percent bullsh-t. Actually … horsesh-t,” and noted in a follow-up post that he “was not contacted by anyone at @NBCNews” regarding the allegations against Hegseth. “Your story is horsesh-t @NBCNews. Put my name on it. On the record. It’ll be your only on the record source,” Cain wrote. “Signed, The guy who sat next to him for 8 hours every week for five years starting at 6am.” “Fox and Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy similarly confirmed on X that “the losers @NBCNews never reached out to [her] either,” and pushed back on the story’s allegations. “@willcain is right — your story IS horsesh-t,” she wrote. “You now have 2 people who sat next to him 8+ hours a week on the record. Will you retract or correct your story?” [READ: The Police Report About Pete Hegseth’s Alleged Sexual Assault Vindicates Him Of Criminality] Campos-Duffy’s daughter and Fox News guest Evita Duffy-Alfonso also voiced her support for Hegseth, writing on X, “I stand with Pete and his beautiful family in the face of these smears.” Federalist Editor-in-Chief and Fox News contributor Mollie Hemingway said she has “nothing but good things to say about Pete and the anonymously sourced stories don’t match [her] personal experience in any way. Quite the contrary, in fact.” “I can’t stand the propaganda practice of using anonymous sources to smear political opponents, as NBC does here,” Hemingway wrote on X.

Former Fox producer and independent journalist Kyle Becker detailed on X how he saw Hegseth “numerous times while working at Fox News,” and “[n]ever got the impression he was ever drunk.” “No bloodshot eyes. No slurred speech. No disheveled appearance. No wobbly gait. Nothing,” Becker wrote. “I’m also calling bullsh-t.” Fox News contributors Guy Benson, Sara Carter, and numerous other network employees and guests have come out in defense of Hegseth against the unsubstantiated claims published by NBC News. 10 “anonymous sources” for @NBCNews.

186,"Biden, during Angola visit, speaks of 'shared history' of slavery","President Joe Biden on Tuesday, during his diplomatic trip to Angola, acknowledged America's ""original sin"" of slavery and the slave trade that once connected the United States and the African nation. ""I've learned that while history can be hidden, it cannot and should not be erased,"" Biden said. ""It should be faced. It's our duty to face our history. The good, the bad and the ugly. The whole truth. That's what great nations do."" The remarks were delivered at the National Museum of Slavery, where Biden said millions of Africans were baptized into a ""foreign faith against their will"" before being forced into slave ships to travel across the Atlantic Ocean. ""We're gathering in a solemn location because to fully consider how far our two countries have come in our friendship, we have to remember how we began,"" Biden said outside the museum on a rainy afternoon. ""We hear them in the wind and the waves: young women, young men born free in the highlands in Angola, only to be captured, bound and forced in a death march along this very coast to this spot by slave traders in the year 1619,"" Biden said. The White House announced earlier this week, as Biden arrived in Angola, that it was giving a $229,000 grant to help with a restoration of the museum and its conservation. The diplomatic trip is aimed at deepening the relationship between the two countries, and marks the first-ever visit to Angola by a sitting U.S. president and the first sub-Saharan trip by an American leader since President Barack Obama in 2015. Biden kicked off the visit with a bilateral meeting earlier Tuesday with President João Lourenco in Luanda. The two men talked about trade and economic opportunities, protecting democracy and the growth of the U.S.-Angola relationship, according to the White House. Biden celebrated the partnership further in his remarks, saying it's as ""strong as it's ever been"" and that the ""United States is all in on Africa's future."" ""The story of Angola and the United States holds a lesson for the world: two nations with a shared history in evil of human bondage, two nations on opposite sides of the Cold War defining struggle in the late part of the 20th century,"" Biden said. ""And now two nations standing shoulder to shoulder, working together every day for the mutual benefit of our people."" ""It's a reminder that no nation need be permanently the adversary of another testament to the human capacity for reconciliation and proof that from every -- from the horrors of slavery and war, there is a way forward,"" Biden added. On Wednesday, Biden will tour part of the Lobito rail corridor, which is being partially financed by the U.S., that will help transport goods and materials across Africa -- a development seen as a way to counter China's influence in the region. White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby touted the project in an interview with ABC News' Alex Presha. Kirby said the administration was ""very confident that the Lobito corridor is going to be a success,"" noting it's a multilateral effort with support from U.S. allies and benefits American companies that will build part of the railway at home before it's transported to Africa.

109,House Probe Into Matt Gaetz Relies On Witnesses DOJ Found Lacked Credibility,"The last eight years at the Department of Justice have been a disaster for the rule of law. The sprawling intelligence and law enforcement agency ran the Russia collusion hoax, hamstringing President Donald Trump during his entire first term in office. It interfered in the 2020 election by falsely telling social media companies that a laptop with incriminating information about the Biden family business was Russian disinformation, and telling them to censor speech and debate about the topic. Under President Joe Biden, the department ran two norm-obliterating politicized prosecutions against Trump in an effort to silence, bankrupt, imprison, and defeat him. Instead of rooting out the corruption at the department, most of permanent D.C. did absolutely nothing in response. Yet somehow the chattering class was shocked when Trump nominated loyal foot soldier Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fl., to be attorney general in Trump’s second term and to fix DOJ. Gaetz had proven to be one of the most effective advocates against corruption at DOJ and was unwilling to back down in the face of overwhelming public pressure. However, Gaetz does not fit the education or experience profile of many previous attorneys general and has limited experience practicing law. Many Americans are sick and tired of elected officials and media pundits doing nothing as DOJ attempted to destroy the country with its abuse of the rule of law. Among the many powerful figures in Washington, D.C. opposed to the Gaetz nomination are some who are attempting to thwart it by releasing a report from the House Ethics Committee that will attempt to tie Gaetz to salacious allegations involving child sex trafficking. The report comes years after DOJ dropped its investigation into the same claims on the grounds that the two central witnesses had serious credibility issues. Yet these are the same two central witnesses the House Ethics Committee has relied on for its critical report of Gaetz—the same report it is leaking to compliant reporters as part of a coordinated effort to thwart his nomination as President-elect Donald Trump’s next attorney general. The two witnesses have massive credibility problems. The claims arose from Joel Greenberg, “one of the most corrupt Florida politicians of all time,” according to Florida reporter Marc Caputo, who is now with the anti-Trump media outlet The Bulwark. Among many things the former Seminole County tax collector admitted to as part of a wide-ranging case for which he is currently serving 11 years in prison was falsely accusing local political opponent Brian Beute of having sex with a minor, similar to the outlandish claim he made against Gaetz. Greenberg also reportedly later attempted to frame his own attorney with pornographic images of children. One New York Times writeup of Greenberg was headlined, “Like the Tiger King Got Elected Tax Collector.“ According to the Washington Post, Greenberg admitted to “fabricating allegations against a schoolteacher who was running against him to be a tax collector. Greenberg had sent letters to the school falsely claiming the teacher had an inappropriate sexual relationship with a student — a similar allegation to the Gaetz case.” U.S. District Judge Gregory Presnell, appointed by President Bill Clinton, said Greenberg’s actions against that innocent victim were “downright evil.” The politicized employees at DOJ have shown themselves willing to explore novel legal theories and bend federal rules to the breaking point in pursuit of their most reviled political opponents, most notably former and future President Trump. Gaetz has a reputation as one of the most tenacious cross-examiners of DOJ officials from his perch on the House Judiciary Committee. Yet even the DOJ was unwilling to exploit Greenberg’s unsubstantiated claims — apart from leaking them to the press to hurt Gaetz’s reputation. They announced their closure of the investigation in 2022. The House Ethics Committee, however, decided to pick up the dropped and deflated ball and run with it a full year after DOJ dropped the investigation. The fact that the disgraced Greenberg was cooperating with the House Ethics Committee was shared for publication with The New York Times and other media outlets. The news media “should not be laundering smears from people in prison,” a Gaetz spokesman said at the time. Gaetz speculated that the House ethics investigation was punishment for his leading role in the controversial defenestration of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a move that angered many of his Republican colleagues. The colorful representative and Trump ally has also won few friends on the Hill by pointing out his colleagues’ suspicious stock trades. Prior to marrying Ginger Luckey in 2021 and settling down, he had a reputation in D.C. for being a partier and dating many women. A little-noticed lawsuit from 2023 gives some insight into Greenberg and two women involved in the scheme against Gaetz. Greenberg alleges one of these women had sex with Gaetz when she was a minor. The other woman is her longtime roommate and friend, two years older, who has reportedly corroborated her friend’s claims. The crime spree Greenberg was convicted of included charges related to his ongoing sexual relationship with the 17-year-old. He met her on a site for older men with money and younger women needing money who are prepared to have sex with older men. The practice matches “sugar daddies” with “sugar babies” and is considered a form of prostitution. The woman lied about her age when she registered on the site, and the married Greenberg maintains he was not aware she was a minor when he began having sex with her. The lawsuit shows that Greenberg “became insistent” that Gaetz help him obtain a pardon for his various crimes. When he was repeatedly told that wouldn’t happen, Greenberg reportedly said he would seek vengeance on those who refused to help him during his time of need. It was at this point that Greenberg began claiming without evidence that Gaetz and a variety of other Republicans and local businessmen were involved in his criminal actions, the lawsuit says. Greenberg was paying the legal bills of Gaetz’s accuser. He allegedly lied about Gaetz to “reduce his own prison sentence,” according to the lawsuit. The latter claim was supported by a September letter from Gaetz to the House Ethics Committee. Gaetz revealed a letter from a jailhouse informant who shared a holding cell with Greenberg when Greenberg admitted “making stuff up about” Gaetz as part of a plan to lighten what could have been as much as a 27-year sentence in federal prison. He was eventually sentenced to 11 years for his role in sex trafficking, identity theft, public corruption involving taxpayer money and contracts, stalking, and securing fraudulent federal business loans. Two former federal agents interviewed the inmate, who told them Greenberg said the woman Greenberg was convicted of having sex with as a minor “would be willing to adopt Greenberg’s lie in hopes of a future financial benefit.” The woman is referenced in news reports and legal documents as “A.B.” A 2023 lawsuit from Chris Dorworth, a former Florida state representative and friend of Gaetz, reveals that Greenberg said A.B. performed deviant acts on the internet for money and “would do whatever he said because he was paying her legal bills.” He even sent a text message to Dorworth confessing he was paying for her legal bills. “I’m having to pay for [A.B.] to retain lawyer,” Greenberg wrote in a text to Dorworth. “They contacted her and are wanting her to talk. She doesn’t want to talk to them. Likely Venmo was the link. I need help with this.” The lawsuit shows that various people Greenberg spoke to about his problems felt he was trying to ensnare them as having been complicit in his crimes, frequently to their confusion. After speaking with Greenberg’s lawyer, Dorworth texted Greenberg, “I have nothing to do with any of this and think it is incredibly uncool you are trying to lawyer me up to be part of it, Joel. Not. F–king. Cool.” The younger woman has gone on to be an “active participant” on OnlyFans and has appeared in pornographic videos under a stage name, according to the lawsuit. News reports claim she told the House Ethics Committee the same information she told the DOJ before it closed the investigation on the grounds she and Greenberg had credibility problems. Judge Presnell referred to the woman as “essentially a prostitute.” The DOJ decided that the people making the accusations against Gaetz had such massive credibility problems that they could in no way charge him with any crimes. All the House Ethics Committee has done is revive those same accusations from the same unreliable witnesses. As they did with the salacious accusations contained in the Democrat-funded Russia collusion dossier and the Washington Post’s unsubstantiated report against then-federal judge Brett Kavanaugh, the people who run Washington appear not to be concerned about the validity of the accusations so much as the ability to use them to stop a political opponent.",Federalist,Right,1484,"Right

Jim Jordan (R-OH), the chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary, fired off a letter to the Biden Department of Justice demanding the Office of Professional Responsibility provide critical information about the operations of Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team’s efforts to prosecute Donald Trump.Smith had charged Trump with trying to subvert the 2020 presidential election in one case and mishandling classified documents in another.“The information that you have provided only reinforces our concerns that OPR acts more to protect Department prosecutors than to root out prosecutorial misconduct,” Jordan wrote to Jeffrey Ragsdale, the counsel for OPR. “While we appreciate you confirming an open investigation into Jack Smith’s prosecutors, we are concerned that your refusal to take prompt investigative steps will allow these attorneys to evade internal accountability by leaving the Department.”CHECK OUT THE DAILY WIRE HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDEJordan referred to a letter the Committee wrote in May in which they asked for “documents related to OPR’s investigations into allegations that Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team lied to a federal court, manipulated evidence seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) during its raid of Mar-a-Lago, and improperly pressured a lawyer representing a defendant indicted by Smith.”AdvertisementThe Committee followed up with another letter in August regarding professional misconduct regarding another member of Smith’s team, J.P. Cooney. After receiving no response, the Committee asked Ragsdale to make himself available to the Committee in September and followed up with another request in October regarding all their requests.On November 19, Ragsdale told the Committee that OPR had opened an investigation into Smith’s office in June 2023, but OPR did not conduct an “inquiry” or “investigation” into the allegations because it could “interfer[e] with” and “jeopardize” the prosecution, Jordan wrote.“As you explained it, the Department’s policy would keep bad-actor attorneys in place to continue prosecutorial misconduct because of the administrative difficulty and resource constraints involved in switching attorneys,” Jordan wrote. “This excuse not only defies common sense, but it seems to violate the Department’s mission to ensure that justice is done in every case.”AdvertisementAfter Trump was elected, Smith revealed that his team was “making moves to wind down the two criminal cases.”“Smith then gave your office permission to investigate the allegations of attorney misconduct by Smith’s office. You stated that Smith only allowed the investigation to begin because it would now no longer ‘interfere with the Special Counsel’s investigation and prosecution,’",DailyWire,Right,404,"Lean Right

159,John Bolton Asks Deep State To Deep-Six Trump Nominees Before They Fix Corrupt Intel Agencies,"Warhawk and former National Security Adviser John Bolton asked the deep state on Wednesday to deep-six former Hawaii Democrat Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and former Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz because their nominations to President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet threaten the establishment. Trump tapped Gaetz to serve as attorney general and Gabbard to serve as director of national intelligence. The picks triggered a meltdown from members of the deep state, including Bolton, who told NewsNation on Wednesday that the FBI should be weaponized to investigate Gaetz and Gabbard in order to “send a message to China that the U.S. is serious about its national security.” “I don’t think either [Gabbard] or Matt Gaetz ought to have a confirmation hearing until they have both had full-field FBI investigations,” Bolton said. “And then I think the Chinese would say, ‘Maybe they are serious.’” “With [Trump’s] announcement of Tulsi Gabbard to be the director of national intelligence, he’s sending a signal that we have lost our mind when it comes to collecting intelligence,” Bolton said. Notably, China managed to fly several spy balloons over the United States under the Biden-Harris administration. “Given the Russian propaganda that she has espoused over the past period of time, I think [Gabbard] is a serious threat to our national security,” Bolton said. Gaetz and Gabbard aren’t strangers to deep-state corruption. Gabbard recently found herself on a Transportation Security Administration watchlist for enhanced surveillance, a whistleblower alleged. Gabbard was reportedly surveilled by federal air marshals on at least eight separate flights after she criticized President Joe Biden in a Fox News appearance. Gaetz was targeted by the deep state in 2021 after an anonymously sourced report from The New York Times accused him of potentially being a child sex trafficker. The story came after Gaetz helped defeat the Russia-collusion hoax perpetrated by radical leftists, criticized the media for their biased coverage of the Black Lives Matter riots, and highlighted the Justice Department’s weaponized actions. After 18 months of the propaganda press tarnishing Gaetz’s reputation for allegedly being a pedophile, The Washington Post (in another anonymously sourced report) said prosecutors would not recommend charges for Gaetz. In simpler terms, the deep-state manufactured a damning story, let it ruminate in the public square for more than a year, and then announced no charges would be brought because there was no evidence. But as The Federalist’s Editor-in-Chief Mollie Hemingway wrote: “Gaetz couldn’t very well critique the Department of Justice for their political prosecutions if he was a pariah who everyone thought was a pedophile.” And now, Bolton wants the Biden-Harris administration to use its remaining weeks in power to sic the FBI on political dissidents all because they threaten to dismantle the intelligence state.",Federalist,Right,451,"Right

Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard, speaking alongside Sheinbaum, called for more regional cooperation and integration instead of a war of retaliatory import taxes. “It’s a shot in the foot,” Ebrard said of Trump’s proposed tariffs, which appear to violate the USMCA trade deal between Mexico, Canada and the U.S. Ebrard warned the tariffs would lead to massive U.S. job losses, lower growth and hit U.S. companies producing in Mexico by effectively doubling the taxes they paid. “The impact on companies is huge,” he said. The proposed tariffs would hit the automotive sector’s top cross-border exporters especially hard, Ebrard added, namely Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. Ebrard noted that 88% of pickup trucks sold in the U.S. are made in Mexico and would see a price increase. These vehicles are popular in rural areas that overwhelmingly voted for Trump. “Our estimate is that the average price of these vehicles will increase by $3,000,” Ebrard said. Sheinbaum and Trump spoke by phone later on Wednesday, with the two discussing topics at the top of Trump’s agenda. Trump had said the tariffs would remain in effect until the flow of drugs – particularly fentanyl – and migrants into the U.S. was controlled. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said Sheinbaum “agreed to stop migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border.” He described the conversation as “very productive.” Sheinbaum later responded on X that she had laid out Mexico’s migration strategy, which “attended to” migrants before they arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border, in her call with Trump. “Mexico’s stance is not to close borders, but to build bridges between governments and their peoples,” she added. In after-hours trading on Wednesday, Mexico’s peso strengthened by as much as nearly 1% against the dollar, reversing losses logged in previous days. Many analysts regard Trump’s tariff threats as more of a negotiating tactic than trade policy. “The lack of a clear link between this threat and questions related to trade suggests the new president plans to use tariffs as a negotiating strategy to achieve goals largely unrelated to trade,” said David Kohl, chief economist at Julius Baer. Mexico’s automotive industry is the country’s most important manufacturing sector, exporting predominantly to the United States. It represents nearly 25% of all North American vehicle production. Analysts at Barclays said they estimate the proposed tariffs “could wipe out effectively all profits” from the Detroit Three automakers. “While it’s generally understood that a blanket 25% tariff on any vehicles or content from Mexico or Canada could be disruptive, investors under-appreciate how disruptive this could be,” they wrote in a note on Tuesday. Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for Trump’s transition team, said the tariffs would protect U.S. manufacturers and workers from “unfair practices of foreign companies and foreign markets.” Hughes said Trump would implement policies to make life affordable and more prosperous for his country. GM and Stellantis declined to comment. Ford did not comment on how the threatened tariffs would affect its business but said it manufactures more vehicles in the United States than most major automakers. Mexico’s automotive industry group AMIA said it would prepare for any possibility and wait to see what formal actions are taken. The Institute of International Finance, a trade group for the global financial services industry, warned Mexico-U.S. relations would be challenging going forward. “The imposition of tariffs, eventually leading to increased protectionism, and other policies affecting exchange rates and commodity prices could have significant implications for the region,” it said in a note. The USMCA is up for review in 2026. Katia Goya, director of international economics at Grupo Financiero Banorte, said it was likely the three USMCA countries would seek wholesale renegotiation of the pact rather than just rubber-stamp it to continue in its current form. “The effect of a trade-conflict situation is that it will mean lower economic growth in the United States, higher unemployment and higher inflation,” Goya said. Ebrard said USMCA trade amounted to $1.78 trillion in the first nine months of this year. “We can fragment and divide with tariffs,” Ebrard said. “Mexico does not want conflicts and divisions, but to build a stronger region.”",CNBC,Center,770,"Center

78,Bill Clinton Says He Wishes Joe Biden Didn't Do This Thing Before Pardoning His Son,"Bill Clinton said Wednesday that you “can’t take the politics out of” presidential pardoning decisions as he weighed in on Joe Biden’s recent pardon of his son Hunter Biden. “I wish he hadn’t said he wasn’t going to do it. I think it does weaken his case,” Clinton said of Joe Biden, who had vowed he wouldn’t pardon his son, who was found guilty in June of illegally owning a gun in 2018 and pleaded guilty in a tax case in September. Clinton, in remarks to Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit, said the president had “reason to believe” his son would likely face “far stronger, adverse consequences” than the average person. On Sunday, Joe Biden said in a statement that his son was “unfairly” and selectively prosecuted, adding that he was “singled out” due to his ties to his father. The move by the president has led to bipartisan condemnation in the days since. Clinton dismissed comparisons of Biden’s pardon to his own 2001 pardon of his half-brother Roger Clinton Jr., who was convicted of cocaine possession and drug trafficking in 1985. “The real question was, would he ever be able to vote again? Would he ever be able to have normal citizenship responsibilities?” said the former president, who noted that his half-brother had already served a 14-month sentence in federal prison at the time. He continued, “And I’ve been sort of upset that there’s been almost no discussion about the larger problem, which is, does the pardon system we have work?” Bill Clinton, who urged Americans to see Biden’s move in a “larger context,” then turned to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ (D-N.Y.) call for the president to also pardon those “in the federal prison system whose lives have been ruined by unjustly aggressive prosecutions for nonviolent offenses.” He said that Biden is “almost certainly right” that his son received “completely different treatments” than he would have otherwise. But the issue over the pardon, he said, isn’t “way high” on his “hierarchy of things” he’s supposed to be upset about. Sorkin later asked Clinton if Biden should pardon President-elect Donald Trump in what could be seen as a “balanced” move prior to the change in administrations. “Well, I do think we should stop trying to criminalize politics,” Clinton said. He later continued, “Both of them. ... And the people like it when they are not going along with it from right to left. On the other hand, you have to ask yourself, if you do this as a blanket thing, is there anything a president could do that he or she someday would get in trouble for?”",Huffpost,Left,443,"Lean Left  
The article primarily presents a critique of Joe Biden's pardon of his son by quoting Bill Clinton’s careful analysis of the situation and emphasizing its political implications, which tend to align with Democratic sensibilities. However, it also touches on bipartisan views of the pardon, indicating a nuanced perspective rather than outright support.

231,Wisconsin Democratic Leader Ben Wikler Enters Race to Lead the National Party,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party in Wisconsin, said Sunday he has joined the race to lead the national party after an election that swept Donald Trump and Republicans to power in Washington. “In Wisconsin, we’ve built a permanent campaign,” Wikler said in his candidacy announcement. “We organize and communicate year-round in every corner of the state — rural, suburban, urban, red, blue and purple areas alike.” Since losing control of the White House, the Senate and the House, Democrats are looking for new leadership to tackle the nation's problems with the additional challenge of confronting four more years of a Trump presidency. Top announced candidates to lead the Democratic National Committee include Ken Martin, chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and a vice chair of the national party, and Martin O’Malley, a former Maryland governor and current Social Security administrator. The DNC will choose its successor in February, an election that will speak volumes about how the party wants to present itself during four more years of Trump in the White House. Wikler, who was elected state chair in 2019, cites his experience leading the party's efforts in a state that shifted less toward Trump than other battlegrounds in 2024 and where Democrats won key downballot races. He said that during his tenure, Democrats flipped the majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and reelected Tony Evers as governor. This year, the state returned Sen. Tammy Baldwin for a third term and retook 14 state legislative seats, which he says puts Democrats on track for majorities in both chambers in 2026. “What has made a difference in Wisconsin can made a difference everywhere,” Wikler said. Wikler, 43, has served as a Washington director for MoveOn.org, a progressive advocacy group and as a campaign director for Avaaz, a group that mobilizes members to take on issues such as poverty, climate change and human rights. Wikler told CNN's “Inside Politics Sunday” that Democrats need to show Americans that ""we’re on their side and show who Republicans are for. If we don’t do that, then we’re going to lose.""",TIME,Lean Left,352,"Left  
The article focuses on Ben Wikler, a Democratic leader, and highlights his vision for the Democratic Party amid a challenging political landscape dominated by Republicans. The language used promotes Democratic strategies and critiques the Republican Party.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia’s top military officer called his U.S. counterpart to give advance warning of Russia’s drills in the Mediterranean Sea, officials said Thursday, in what was a rare contact amid high tensions between Moscow and Washington. Russia’s General Staff chief, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, reached out to Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Nov. 27 to inform him about a planned Russian naval exercise involving missile launches in the eastern Mediterranean, the Russian Defense Ministry said. “The information was delivered in order to prevent possible incidents in view of U.S. and NATO warships presence near the area of the Russian exercise,” the ministry said in a statement. The ministry previously reported that the three-day Russian navy drills that wrapped up Tuesday involved two frigates performing practice launches of new hypersonic Zircon cruise missiles and submarine that fired Kalibr cruise missiles. As part of the drills, Russian forces also fired an Onyx missile from a ground launcher at a practice sea target. The Pentagon said Brown and Gerasimov discussed a number of global and regional security issues, including the conflict in Ukraine, in their first call since Brown became chairman in October 2023. Gerasimov informed Brown of the live-fire exercise, but did not discuss specific weapons systems that would be used. Separately, Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, met with two senior officials in the incoming Trump administration, working to nail down crucial support for Ukraine from President-elect Donald Trump. Yermak was in the U.S. on Wednesday for talks with Republican Rep.

It was one of many meetings that Trump aides are having with foreign representatives before Trump takes office Jan. 20, 2025.

356,"More than 80 years later, Pearl Harbor still worth remembering","NEWS AND OPINION: Is it important to remember the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941? Yes. Of course. “Pearl Harbor and World War ll is the line in the sand between the Old World and the New World. America was changed radically and forever. We were ’Fortress America’ walled off by two giant oceans before Pearl Harbor — isolationism ratified by the bipartisan Neutrality Acts. But the nation was internationalist during and after the war,” presidential historian Craig Shirley said in a written statement shared with Inside the Beltway. He is the author of five books on Ronald Reagan along with “December 1941: 31 Days that Changed America and Saved the World,” a bestseller published in 2011 by Thomas Nelson. “FDR and Winston Churchill quite literally saved the world from left wing Nazism and chauvinistic Japan. But the world changed in other ways. Before World War II, anybody above the rank of Second Lieutenant was denigrated through such books as ’All Quiet on the Western Front’ and other popular literature,” Mr. Shirley said. “But during and after the war, men like George Patton and Douglas MacArthur became revered. The workplace changed for women and Blacks. After World War II, the only two countries that had planes in the air were America and England — hence English became the official language of the air, and this continues today,” Mr. Shirley said. WEATHER OR NOT Is a white Christmas in store for the nation? “Bitterly cold air has spread across much of the northern and eastern United States this week, but AccuWeather expert meteorologists say a pattern change on the horizon could lead to milder air and less snow on the ground before the holidays,” a report released Thursday by AccuWeather said. “It’s been a cold start to December for much of the eastern half of the nation. Don’t expect the cold to stick around too much longer. We expect a pattern shift in mid-December with a change from a cold Polar air mass to a milder Pacific air mass, especially for the central and eastern United States,” Paul Pastelok, AccuWeather’s lead long-range forecaster, said in a written statement. “This can lead to snow melt for many areas that received snow at the start of the winter season, not leaving too much snow around just before Christmas,” he said. Stay tuned. AccuWeather will issue the official 2024 white Christmas forecast in mid-December. In the meantime, the organization’s meteorologists have reviewed cold-weather records to determine which major U.S. cities have the highest odds of experiencing a white Christmas. “Historical data from 1991-2020 shows that none of the 25 most-populated cities in the United States have much more than a one-in-three chance of getting an inch or more of snow on the ground on Christmas morning,” AccuWeather said. APPLAUSE FOR KELLY The Heritage Foundation has offered some formal congratulations to former Sen. Kelly Loeffler. The Georgia Republican was just appointed to lead the Small Business Administration in President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming administration. “Kelly’s inspiring journey, from growing up on a farm in Illinois to building a successful career in business and public service, is a testament to her dedication, hard work, and passion for the American Dream,” Kevin Roberts, president of the foundation, said in a written statement shared with the Beltway. Small businesses, he said, are struggling under high taxes, excessive regulations and anti-growth policies. “Her unwavering commitment to faith, family, and hard work will undoubtedly continue to drive her as she leads the Small Business Administration in empowering small businesses across the country,” Mr. Roberts said.

76,Unlikely battleground California plays key role -- again -- in setting US House’s political balance,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Democrats and Republicans agreed on at least one thing before November’s election: California would play a central role in determining control of the U.S. House. Indeed it did. Democrat Adam Gray’s come-from-behind victory over Republican Rep. John Duarte in a Central Valley farm-belt district Tuesday — the final House contest decided this year — gave Democrats their third pick-up of a GOP-held seat in the state, a small victory in a tough year for Democrats nationally. While Democratic wins narrowed the gap in the House, Republicans held their ground in two other toss-up contests that helped the GOP defend its fragile majority in Washington. Republicans won 220 House seats this election cycle, with Democrats holding 215 seats. Despite falling short of a majority, Democrats stressed that the party will gain seats next year, leaving the chamber even more closely divided. “Netting three seats was a very big deal,” Rep. Pete Aguilar, the third-ranking Democrat in the chamber, who lives in Redlands, east of Los Angeles, said in Washington. Democratic enthusiasm was tempered, however, by turnout figures that lagged the 2020 presidential election in the heavily Democratic state, even with Kamala Harris leading the Democratic ticket in her home state. Also, Republicans made incremental gains in the state Legislature. Voters overwhelmingly endorsed a ballot proposal that makes shoplifting a felony for repeat offenders again and increases penalties for some drug charges amid frustration over retail crimes, a proposal opposed by some Democrats. The election showed Democrats will need to pay closer attention to issues like crime and the cost of living, even in a state where the party holds every statewide office and dominates the Legislature and congressional delegation, Claremont McKenna College political scientist Jack Pitney said. In the House, Democrats “were hoping that California would push them over the top to gain a majority. But their gains elsewhere were not strong enough,” Pitney added, pointing to GOP wins in North Carolina. Gray won by a margin of less than 200 votes, with election officials reporting Tuesday all ballots had been counted. Duarte captured the seat in 2022 when he defeated Gray by one of the closest margins in the country, 564 votes. He was often listed among the most vulnerable House Republicans given that narrow margin of victory in a district with a Democratic tilt — about 11 points over registered Republicans. Gray said in a statement: “We always knew that this race would be as close as they come, and we’re expecting a photo finish this year, too.” In other Democratic House gains, first-time candidate Derek Tran ousted Republican Rep. Michelle Steel in a Southern California district anchored in Orange County, while Democrat George Whitesides toppled Republican Rep. Mike Garcia is a district north of Los Angeles. In a district east of Los Angeles, Republican Rep. Ken Calvert again held off Democrat Will Rollins in a repeat of their 2022 contest. And Republican Rep. David Valadao kept his grip on a farm-belt seat, despite its heavy Democratic registration edge. The outcome will leave Republicans with nine of the state’s 52 U.S. House seats next year. Although California is often seen as a liberal monolith, a string of House districts has proved volatile in recent elections, spotlighting their importance to both parties. Democrats snatched seven seats from Republicans in 2018, then Republicans seized four from Democrats in 2020. In the 2022 elections, Republicans gained one seat, from 11 to 12, while Democrats dropped to 40 seats from 42, after California lost a House seat in reapportionment after the 2020 census. Overall, the state dropped to 52 districts from 53. The state played a pivotal role in securing the gavel for Republicans in 2022 and installing Rep.

391,Rep. Seth Moulton: Democrats Are Wearing an ‘Ideological Straitjacket’,"In a parallel universe, progressives would be rallying around Democratic congressman Seth Moulton. They would respect his courage for saying what so many of them have been thinking since Donald Trump thumped Kamala Harris in the presidential election. They would be urging him—publicly—to run for president. A billionaire, probably in Silicon Valley or New York, would have launched a super PAC called “Moulton 2028,” calling the congressman “the voice America needs.” They would love him.But in this universe, the one we actually inhabit, they hate him.“We’ve worked so hard at becoming tolerant that we’ve become intolerant,” Moulton, who represents the suburbs north of Boston, told me Wednesday.The hate started exactly two weeks ago, when Moulton told The New York Times, in an article explaining why Kamala Harris lost, that the Democratic Party had become overly focused on trans issues.“Democrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face,” Moulton told the Times. “I have two little girls, I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that.” Moulton’s daughters are 6 and 3, and he told me he was talking about team sports they might play when they’re older. When I asked what prompted him to make comments that he must have known would antagonize his fellow Democrats—who have long adhered to the orthodoxy that trans women are women who should be able to compete in women’s sports—he replied: “I was speaking authentically as a dad about a concern that I know other dads share, and we just ought to be able to debate it.”Since then, progressives have called him a “Nazi cooperator,” “transphobic,” and “offensive.” Democrats have said he should resign. His campaign manager has stepped down. Massachusetts Democratic governor Maura Healey, who is gay, attacked Moulton for “playing politics.” Even Jake Auchincloss, who, like Moulton, is a former Marine and now a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, has distanced himself from Moulton’s trans remarks. (Moulton declined to comment on Auchincloss.) Meanwhile, the chair of Tufts University’s political science department threatened to bar students from interning in Moulton’s office, which prompted the college’s high command to assure the congressman they still like him (Tufts is a major recipient of National Institutes of Health grants; probably not wise to lash out at a member of the Massachusetts congressional delegation.) Which prompted the editorial board at The Tufts Daily, predictably, to condemn Moulton.“[W]e believe that cutting ties with Moulton’s office is not a suppression of speech,” the board wrote. “In fact, it is quite the opposite. It is our way of expressing our disgust with Moulton’s brazen scapegoating of an already oppressed community.” This post is for paying subscribers only Subscribe now Already have an account?

The article discusses Representative Seth Moulton's criticism of the Democratic Party's focus on trans issues, depicting him as a voice for honest debate. It highlights backlash from progressives who see his comments as offensive. This framing suggests an awareness of internal party conflicts, leaning toward a leftist critique of the party, while simultaneously representing a more moderate voice in a traditionally left-leaning context. The language used resembles that of a liberal commentary rather than a purely objective report, which further supports the ""Lean Left"" classification."

The article prominently features Democratic criticism of Republican actions regarding the Matt Gaetz ethics report, indicating a slant toward favoring accountability for alleged misconduct. It highlights emotional reactions from Democratic lawmakers and frames the Republicans' decision as a lack of accountability, which suggests a bias toward Democratic perspectives. The focus on allegations against a Republican figure and the reaction of Democrats also indicates a tendency to emphasize a particular narrative rather than presenting an even-handed account of the situation."

363,House Republicans Say Federal Government Buried 2023 Report Supporting LNG Exports,"House Republicans say the Biden administration buried a 2023 analysis that cautioned against imposing its January 2024 pause in processing new liquified natural gas (LNG) export permits and continues to dodge congressional requests to provide documents that justified the decision.Those claims were among allegations that GOP panelists lodged against the Department of Energy (DOE) during a 75-minute Dec. 4 hearing staged by the House Oversight and Accountability Committee’s Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs Subcommittee.“Reports indicate that before the ban, the White House met with activists and TikTok influencers—I’m not making that up—who were adamant the administration take radical steps to address climate change and eliminate fossil fuels,” said the subcommittee’s chair, Rep. Pat Fallon (R-Texas). Story continues below advertisement Despite a year of committees requesting documents relevant to the pause with little success, Fallon said it was upsetting to learn through a nonprofit’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request that 97 documents totaling 4,354 pages of LNG analyses were not provided by DOE in response to queries.“As it turns out, there may have already been a 2023 study in existence that the department kept under wraps and is still fighting to withhold,” Fallon said.“It appears possible that when the information ... did not fit the narrative pushed by the White House, that information was buried in an attempt to clear the way for a more politically favorable analysis.”Related StoriesUS LNG Production Surge Will Double Exports by 2028: EIA9/7/2024Federal Regulator Greenlights Louisiana LNG Terminal, Pipeline6/27/2024Assistant U.S. Secretary of Energy for Fossil Energy and Carbon Management Brad Crabtree denied knowledge of any such study.“I’ve not been presented with the document, so I’m not aware of what you’re referring to,” he said, noting that if it exists, it is among many studies that prompted the pause. Story continues below advertisement President Joe Biden announced on Jan. 26 that DOE would not process new LNG export permits to non-free-trade-agreement countries because analytics needed to be updated to ascertain “potential energy cost increases for American consumers and manufacturers” and “the impact of greenhouse gas emissions.”Under the Natural Gas Act, DOE must review applications to export LNG to ensure they are “consistent with the public interest,” primarily if exports would raise domestic prices and cause environmental damage. DOE last conducted such a study in 2018.The administration said it would publish DOE’s draft report by late 2024. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has repeatedly said a draft would be available by December and finalized by February 2025, including on May 23 before the House Oversight and Accountably Committee.Regardless of the study, the permit pause is set to be lifted on Jan. 20, 2025, after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. Repealing the pause is among a flurry of “Day One” executive orders he vows to issue. Story continues below advertisement Crabtree confirmed the report would be published in “mid-December” and would include a 60-day comment period.House Republicans maintain that the Biden administration has never been transparent about the data it used to justify the pause.The House Oversight and Accountability Committee and subcommittees have staged at least 17 hearings on Biden’s energy policies, including the LNG pause, in the past two years. They’ve requested DOE provide documents related to the pause since March with little success.An LNG tanker is guided by tug boats at the Cheniere Sabine Pass LNG export unit in Cameron Parish, La., on April 14, 2022. Marcy de Luna/Reuters Story continues below advertisement Documents Acknowledged, Not ReleasedThe revelation that nearly 100 documents spanning more than 4,000 pages were not provided in response to queries inadvertently surfaced in a Sept. 13 FOIA request filed by Government Accountability & Oversight (GAO), a Washington-based “public interest” watchdog.GOA’s FOIA specifically sought “documents and correspondence within the Department of Energy related to a purported 2023 liquefied natural gas export study” that it claims “was buried by senior agency officials to justify a pause of LNG export authorizations.”The nonpartisan nonprofit says that to support the permit freeze, the administration tossed analyses by DOE’s National Energy Technology Lab and the U.S. Energy Information Administration and, instead, relied on a 2023 study that was not peer-reviewed and has since been rebuffed.That study, “The Greenhouse Gas Footprint of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Exported from the United States” by Cornell University professor David Howarth, maintains, among other claims, that LNG is worse for the climate than coal. Story continues below advertisement Howarth’s study has been cited as flawed by Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future’s research and Berkeley Research Group, which in an April study found that U.S. LNG delivered to Europe and Asia has a greenhouse gas intensity 50 percent to 55 percent lower than the coal it would displace.“The work of Dr. Howarth played no role in the decision,” Crabtree said. “Our methodology is fundamentally different from that of Mr. Howarth.”GAO’s FOIA seeks “any LNG export study transmitted by the National Energy Technology Lab to DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management between Jan. 1, 2023 and Oct. 31, 2023.”DOE, however, “has unilaterally reinterpreted” what documents GAO is seeking “as applying only to records [DOE] asserts are ‘final’ or ‘ready for release’ for the public’s view,” it maintains. Story continues below advertisement Reps. Russell Fry (R-S.C.), August Pfluger (R-Texas), Scott Perry (R-Pa.), Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), and Clay Higgins (R-La.) interrogated Crabtree about the undisclosed documents and why DOE is not releasing them.“It is my understanding our team that works on document production has been in cooperative engagement with the committee,” Crabtree said, adding “four document distributions” fostered by GAO’s FOIA have been released and “the next one, I understand, is planned for Friday.”He said 2,000 pages had been made public since September but that he’s “not part of the process”“So I can’t speak to the details of that process. In my role, I have no involvement in it. But if you feel that the department has not been responsive to the committee, I’m happy to take any specific concerns back to that team,” he said.

Was the White House relying on TikTok influencers for policy advice when it pushed the LNG ban?

I hope that will extend to the new subcommittee that a certain billionaire social media owner is hoping to intersect with right here in this committee in the coming years,” she said.She said she’s “intrigued” that colleagues “are suddenly very concerned about foreign influence over American energy production,“ alleging that ”Russian disinformation” is heard daily inside the committee.",TheEpicTimes,Lean Right,1352,"Lean Right  
The article presents a narrative that favors House Republicans and their position against the Biden administration’s pause on LNG export permits. The emphasis on allegations of governmental secrecy and a lack of transparency aligns more closely with a Lean Right perspective, as it critiques Democratic policies while downplaying the complexities of energy regulation and environmental consideration focused on higher energy costs for Americans. The focus on Republican statements and framing of their questions also suggests convenience in the narrative that leans towards a conservative viewpoint."
102,Jan. 6 Defendant Gets Reduced Prison Sentence,"A Texas man who was the first protester to go on trial for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol was resentenced on Friday to nearly seven years in prison after he delivered an angry, profane rant to the judge who agreed to modestly reduce his original sentence. Guy Reffitt benefitted from a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that led to the dismissal of his conviction on an obstruction charge. His new sentence — six years and eight months — is seven months lower than his original sentence. Reffitt repeatedly shook his head and appeared to be agitated as he listened to U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich and a prosecutor describe his role in a mob's attack on the Capitol. He told the judge that he was ""in my feelings"" and upset about the ""lies and the craziness"" that he perceived. ""I was not there to take over no government,"" Reffitt said. ""I love this country."" ""No one has a problem with your feelings,"" the judge said. ""It's the actions you took with your feelings."" Reffitt stormed the Captiol with a holstered handgun on his waist. He also was carrying zip-tie handcuffs and wearing body armor and a helmet equipped with a video camera when he advanced on police officers outside the building. He retreated after an officer pepper sprayed him in the face, but he waved on other rioters who ultimately breached the building. Prosecutors said Reffitt told fellow members of the Texas Three Percenters militia group that he planned to drag House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., out of the Capitol building by her ankles, ""with her head hitting every step on the way down."" ""His objective was to overtake Congress, physically and with violence,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Nestler. ""In his own words,"" Nestler added, ""Congress was the demon and he was going to cut the head off the demon."" Reffitt is one of several Jan. 6 defendants to be resentenced after a Supreme Court ruling in June limited the government's use of a federal obstruction law. The high court ruled 6-3 that a charge of obstructing an official proceeding must include proof that a defendant tried to tamper with or destroy documents — a distinction that applies to few Jan. 6 criminal cases. A jury convicted Reffitt of four other counts, including a charge that he threatened his two teenage children after returning to their in home in Wylie, Texas, after the attack. Reffitt’s son Jackson, then 19, testified that his father told him and his younger sister, then 16, that they would be traitors if they reported him to authorities and warned them that ""traitors get shot."" Reffitt's two daughters spoke favorably of their father during his resentencing. They described him as a caring father who doesn't pose a danger to anybody. Prosecutors said Reffitt’s recent communications from jail indicate that he ""views his imprisonment as an injustice and as part of a greater cause, and that he maintains pride in actions on January 6 and his involvement in the community of those who he believes have been wrongly prosecuted for their crimes on that day."" More than 1,500 people have been charged with Capitol attack-related crimes. About 1,000 of them have pleaded guilty. Roughly 250 others have been convicted by a judge or jury after a trial.",NewsMax,Right,554,"Center

119,Venezuelan Migrant Charged with Killing 7-Year-Old Ivory Smith in Texas Drunk Driving Crash,"A Venezuelan migrant is accused of killing 7-year-old Ivory Smith and severely injuring her mother, Christina Quainoo, in a drunk driving crash in Harris County, Texas, last weekend. Joel Enrique Gonzalez Chacin, a 41-year-old Venezuelan national, was arrested on Dec. 1 by the Harris County Sheriff’s Office and charged with felony intoxicated vehicular manslaughter after allegedly causing a crash that killed Ivory Smith and left her mother critically injured. Ivory’s family has set up a GoFundMe to help raise money for her family. “Ivory brought so much light into our lives in her short time with us, and we will forever cherish the joy and love she gave so freely,” the GoFundMe reads. “As we navigate this profound loss, we are also facing the difficult reality of seeking justice for Ivory.” Ivory Smith (Photo via Facebook) According to police, Chacin allegedly ran a red light and hit Quainoo’s vehicle. Ivory was killed in the crash and Quainoo was critically injured. Investigators said that instead of helping Quainoo or providing potentially life-saving aid to Ivory, Chacin got out of his vehicle and started taking photos of the crash. “It’s behavior we’ve never encountered before,” a Harris County official said. Chacin remains in Harris County Jail on a $150,000 bond. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has placed a detainer on Chacin so that if he is released from jail at any time, he will be turned over to agents for deportation. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Email him at jbinder@breitbart.com. Follow him on Twitter here.",Breitbart,Right,257,"Right  
The article focuses on a crime committed by a Venezuelan migrant, which is framed in a way that emphasizes immigration and criminal behavior. This aligns with right-leaning narratives that often portray immigrants in a negative light, particularly regarding crime. Additionally, the inclusion of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer further reinforces its alignment with conservative viewpoints surrounding immigration enforcement. Overall, the tone and emphasis suggest a rightward bias in the reporting."
125,40 Things To Be Grateful For After Trump’s Historic Win,"God gives secular blessings. The right just got some. Contra the buffoons at NPR, Thanksgiving is not a secular holiday. Nevertheless, God’s blessings do touch the worldly here and now. This season, it is only right to reflect on what we had hoped for in the months preceding the election and what the outcome achieved. With the forces of leftism soundly (if impermanently) beaten, we have many reasons to be thankful. Here are 40 of them: 1. A coalition of married, working-class, religious, suburban, exurban, and rural voters stood up for the America they remember, which isn’t quite lost. 2. Black and brown citizens flocked to Trump, thereby putting to bed the idiotic smear that MAGA is a “white” movement. 3. Americans rejected a near-decade of lawfare, fake dossiers, soft coups, and conspiracy theories. 4. The #Resistance is in tatters. 5. Democrats have been punished for ignoring their voters, deep-sixing their duly chosen nominee, and installing in his place a world-historically stupid diversity hire. 6. Kamala Harris has been revealed once and for all as unfit to be a Walmart greeter, never mind a state attorney general, senator, vice president, or major party nominee. 7. The American people watched Joe Biden’s debate performance and held in scorn the deep-staters and media lackeys who lied about the condition of his brain. 8. Against all conventional wisdom, Trump evidently won the popular vote, thus cementing conservative populism as a lasting political force. 9. Tim Walz will now take his Mao-loving, baby-killing, trans-pandering ass back to Minnesota, prancing and simpering all the way. 10. Men have rejected “men.” 11. We have seen the election of Trump’s worthy successor, as articulate and fearless a defender of rights as the American political system has produced this century. 12. The Never Vancers are pounding sand. 13. Wokeness and DEI were on the ballot and have been exposed as the nation-destroying catastrophes they are. 14. Meritocracy is coming back, as is colorblindness as a national ethic. 15. Those who can define “woman” are ending the political careers of those who can’t. 16. Trans-mania has taken its rightful place among the biggest electoral liabilities of the millennium, joining “Defund the Police” in the annals of pure voter-alienating poison. 17. We get to watch Harris produce unwatchable Netflix specials or run Cal Berkeley into the ground. 18. We may never hear that woman laugh again. 19. MAGA hats are showing up on college kids, retirees, veterans, business owners, and legal immigrants. 20. Migrant caravans are turning around. 21. Our incoming chief executive believes in the nation-state as a protector of human flourishing. 22. We get to hear the “borders are racist” crowd sob. 23. Ol’ Joe shook hands with “Hitler” and grinned. 24. In fact, he seemed awfully chipper when Harris lost. 25. Cabinet appointments are going to men and women who reject the dead consensus, both for policy’s sake and because the uniparty doesn’t own this country. 26. Career bureaucrats are considering heading for the exits. 27. America may now cease to pay for Hamas’ rockets and the reconstruction of “Palestine.” 28. The U.S.’s Ukraine policy will shift from “help them lose slowly forever” to “negotiate a reasonable settlement.” 29. We got to watch Jimmy Kimmel, Sunny Hostin, and Van Jones rend their garments on live television. 30. We have witnessed the political comeback of the most pro-life president in modern history. 31. We’re reading mournful David French columns, not celebratory ones. 32. Democrats are “election deniers” once again, beclowning themselves in close districts and alienating swing voters in the bargain. 33. The corporate media look like the biased, thoughtless, Trump-deranged villains they are. 34. CNN has committed to a purge. 35. So might MSNBC. 36. Persecuted Christians, pro-lifers, and parents will hopefully get a reprieve from an out-of-control FBI. 37. Conservatism is rising from its crouch and showing Democrats that the state’s destruction of innocents will not go unanswered. 38. President Trump will withdraw from the Paris Agreement, kill Biden’s ridiculous electric-vehicle subsidies, and drill, baby, drill. 39. Title IX might protect actual women again. 40. July 4, 2026, will come with fireworks, not apologies. In sum, we have learned our country is not yet dead, that the American nation can still be reclaimed, and that our children can have some share in it. The horizon is brighter today than it was yesterday. Let us give thanks.",Federalist,Right,730,"Right

308,UnitedHealth executive Brian Thompson's murder: what's known about the shooting and the suspect,"Dec 5 (Reuters) - New York City police were still searching for the man who killed UnitedHealth (UNH.N), opens new tab executive Brian Thompson outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel early Wednesday. Here is what is known about the incident, Thompson, and the suspect: At about 6:45 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Thompson was walking from his hotel alone towards a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan when a gunman approached from behind and shot him in the back. Thompson staggered and fell to the ground. A witness is seen fleeing in surveillance video as the gunman, wearing a dark-colored hoodie and a backpack, approaches Thompson and fires a second time. His gun appears to jam, and after fiddling with the weapon, he resumed firing from a short distance. The gunman then fled across the street. Following that, according to the New York Police Department, he got on a bike that he rode into nearby Central Park, where he was last seen. Police said the gunman arrived outside the hotel several minutes before Thompson and waited for him to walk past before firing, ignoring other passers-by. Thompson, 50, lived in Maple Grove, Minnesota. He had been the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group's insurance unit, since April 2021. He was in New York for the company's annual investor conference when he was killed. He had worked at different divisions of UnitedHealth for about 20 years. His wife Paulette said in a statement that ""Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives."" Thompson graduated from the University of Iowa in 1997 with degrees in business administration and accounting, according to his LinkedIn page. Prior to becoming CEO of UnitedHealthcare, he was the head of its government programs business and before that its Medicare and retirement business. UnitedHealth is the largest U.S. health insurer. The company, along with Thompson and two other executives, were sued in May by a Hollywood, Florida, pension fund, which accused the company of insider trading after being made aware of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into UnitedHealth. Surveillance video suggests that he used a silencer, but Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters that could not be verified by that video alone. The gun has not been located. CNN reported that the killer dropped a phone and a bottle of water in an alleyway nearby. Investigators have not yet named a suspect, though CNN reported that police were searching a hostel in New York's Upper West Side where he may have stayed prior to the attack. Police published a number of photographs of the suspect taken from video cameras in the area, including one with the gun raised and pointed toward Thompson and another of the suspect fleeing on a bike. He appears to be light-skinned and of average build. Other photos captured a glimpse of his eyes, brow and the bridge of his nose as he stood in a cafe. Police do not yet know the motive.

291,Donald Trump's Mass Deportations: California Lawmakers Set To Fight Back,"As the incoming administration prepares to take office, promising mass deportations, California lawmakers are taking proactive steps to defend the state's values and protect its immigrant community.In a move aimed at ensuring the state is ready for any potential challenges from the federal government, the California legislature has kicked off a special session to provide additional resources for legal action if needed.""We need to be prepared, and while we hope to collaborate and avoid litigation, we have a responsibility to California residents and taxpayers to make sure we're not caught flat-footed,"" Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, who represents the San Fernando Valley and chairs the Assembly Budget Committee, told Newsweek.California is perhaps uniquely equipped to square off against President-elect Donald Trump's new administration's plans, as the state possesses the second largest Department of Justice (DOJ) in the country.Newsweek has contacted the Trump-Vance transition team for comment via email.The special session was intended to tackle a range of issues, including protecting immigrant families, ensuring reproductive freedom, safeguarding civil rights, and securing California's financial interests, particularly in the face of threats to withhold federal funding.

Collectively they would set aside $25 million for additional legal expenses that the Department of Justice could access if necessary. The idea here is that the special session would be narrow and focused on the provision of those additional resources and that we could debate and pass this legislation prior to January 20.""Some of the focus is on the potential hard-line immigration policies Trump has promised from Day One, including mass deportations.At last estimates in 2022, California was home to at least 2.1 million undocumented migrants, who now face an uncertain future in the U.S. ""Because immigrants are such an important part of the fabric of the state of California there's already been a lot of action taken on that front during the prior administrations to help protect and support immigrant communities,"" Gabriel said.

The guidance was first issued during Trump's last term, in 2018.""Many public institutions already have policies in place for how to respond to immigration enforcement authorities—and we advise those who do not to make a plan today,"" Bonta said in a statement.""My office will continue to use the full force of the law and every tool at our disposal to protect the rights of California's immigrants—and we need staff at these critical locations to do the same.""The guidance, for courthouses, health care facilities, colleges and universities, K-12 schools, labor agencies, public libraries, and shelters is meant to keep immigration officials away from vulnerable migrants.Los Angeles Police Department's new Chief, Jim McDonnell, told The Associated Press this week that his team was ready to protect migrants, adding that it has rules in place preventing officers from getting involved in immigration enforcement.Fighting the federal government may not be as straightforward as it perhaps was between 2017 and 2021, however, with a changing court landscape which recently saw an appeals court overrule local authority in Washington state.

14,Trump nominates cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins as SEC chair,"President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump said Atkins, the CEO of Patomak Partners and a former SEC commissioner, was a “proven leader for common sense regulations.” In the years since leaving the SEC, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation. “He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. The commission oversees U.S. securities markets and investments and is currently led by Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government’s crackdown on the crypto industry. Gensler, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, announced last month that he would be stepping down from his post on the day that Trump is inaugurated — Jan. 20, 2025. Trump, once a crypto skeptic, had pledged to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. Money has poured into crypto assets since he won. The value of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, passed $100,000 Wednesday. And shares in crypto platform Coinbase have surged more than 70% since the election. Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, congratulated Atkins in a post on X. “We appreciate his commitment to balance in regulating U.S. securities markets and look forward to his fresh leadership at (the SEC),” Grewal wrote. “It’s sorely needed and cannot come a day too soon.” Congressman Brad Sherman, a California Democrat and a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, said he worries Atkins would not sufficiently regulate cryptocurrencies as SEC chair. “He’d probably take the position that no cryptocurrency is a security, and hence no exchange that deals with crypto is a securities exchange,” Sherman said. “The opportunity to defraud investors would be there in a very significant way.” Atkins began his career as a lawyer and has a long history working in the financial markets sector, both in government and private practice. In the 1990s, he worked on the staffs of two former SEC chairmen, Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt. His work as an SEC commissioner started in 2002, a time when the fallout from corporate scandals at Enron and WorldCom had turned up the heat on Wall Street and its government regulators. Atkins was widely considered the most conservative member of the SEC during his tenure at the agency and known to have a strong free-market bent. As a commissioner, he called for greater transparency in and analysis of the costs and benefits of new SEC rules. He also emphasized investor education and increased enforcement efforts against those who steal from investors over the internet, manipulate markets, engage in Ponzi schemes and other types of fraud. At the same time, Atkins objected to stiff penalties imposed on companies accused of fraudulent conduct, contending that they did not deter crime. He caused a stir in the summer of 2006 when he said the practice of granting stock options to executives before the disclosure of news that was certain to increase the share price did not constitute insider trading. U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Atkins has the experience needed to “restore faith in the SEC.” “I’m confident his leadership will lead to clarity for the digital asset ecosystem and ensure U.S. capital markets remain the envy of the world,” McHenry posted on X. Atkins already has some experience working for Trump. During Trump’s first term, Atkins was a member of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, an advisory group of more than a dozen CEOs and business leaders who offered input on how to create jobs and speed economic growth. In 2017, Atkins joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization. Crypto industry players welcomed Trump’s victory in the hopes that he would push through legislative and regulatory changes that they’ve long lobbied for. Trump himself has launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",APNEWS,Left,705,"Lean Right

195,South Korea is reeling after spending hours under a surprise martial law declaration,"In a stunning move that threw the nation into turmoil, South Korea's president, Yoon Suk Yeol, invoked martial law on Tuesday, only to reverse course six hours later. The decree, which brought temporary military control and the suspension of civilian government activities and civil liberties, marked South Korea's first declaration of martial law since the country's democratization in 1987. The last time that a South Korean leader declared martial law was in 1979, in the aftermath of the assassination of the president. The resulting turmoil in this instance could be felt for some time. Calls are growing for the president's resignation. All six opposition parties filed an impeachment motion on Wednesday, with a vote set for Friday or Saturday, according to the Yonhap news agency. After Yoon ordered martial law, South Korea's parliament voted unanimously to block the decree, declaring the move invalid, but martial law remained in effect. Yoon announced he would lift martial law and withdraw troops the following day. The Joint Chiefs of Staff then said that the deployed troops had returned to their original units. In the aftermath, Yoon's cabinet approved the reversal. But the reversal of the order wasn't enough to stymie economic anxieties that arose out of the unrest. On Wednesday, South Korea's Kospi Index closed 1.4% lower. The won fell to its lowest level since October 2022 but trimmed losses in Asian hours. Companies in the country, including South Korea's SK Group, a conglomerate of semiconductor and energy businesses, and Korean shipbuilder HD Hyundai, were hosting emergency executive meetings in the early morning hours on Wednesday, per Bloomberg. ""We are concerned that these events could impact South Korea's sovereign credit rating, although this is uncertain at this stage,"" wrote Min Joo Kan, ING Economics' senior economist in Seoul, in a research note. The leader of Yoon's party said that the ruling party feels ""deeply sorry to the public,"" adding that ""the president must directly and thoroughly explain this tragic situation"" and that those who called for martial law should be held accountable. Yoon's entire cabinet and all of his aides have offered to resign, according to local reports. Meanwhile, the country's largest labor union, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, is on indefinite strike, demanding Yoon's resignation, which could hurt production. On Wednesday, thousands gathered for protest rallies across the country, including outside South Korea's national assembly. Yoon indicated the move was necessary to counter North Korea, but the move appears to be at least partly political. In a televised address, he spoke of ""anti-state forces,"" saying martial law was necessary to eliminate them quickly and ""normalize the country."" He also criticized the country's opposition politicians, responding to a series of political setbacks that have frustrated his agenda. Yoon has suffered from low approval ratings this year and has been described by critics as a ""lame-duck president,"" as he holds the nation's highest office without having a majority in its legislature. Yoon's conservative People Power Party lost a general election in April, in which the rival Democratic Party of Korea took 175 of the 300 seats in the National Assembly. The opposition majority in parliament last week voted to cut almost $3 billion from Yoon's 2025 budget, undermining his plans. They have also tried to impeach three top prosecutors, The Associated Press reported. Even as he reversed his martial law decision, Yoon continued to criticize those he saw as frustrating his agenda, requesting in a later address that the National Assembly ""immediately stop its reckless actions that paralyze the functions of the state through repeated impeachment, legislative manipulation, and budget manipulation."" The decision to invoke martial law led to parliamentary activity being prohibited, according to the country's government-funded Yonhap news agency. Anyone who violated the rules could have been arrested without a warrant. The outlet also said that media and publishers fell under the control of South Korea's military. The provisions of martial law also allowed for the suspension of certain civil liberties. Yoon's late-night announcement prompted protests outside parliament, with some trying to climb its walls. There was also intense criticism of Yoon for short-circuiting the country's democracy. Han Dong-hoon, the leader of the ruling People Power Party, said imposing martial law was ""wrong"" and that he would ""stop it with the people."" South Korea's main opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, described the move as unconstitutional. Yoon was already an unpopular leader in Korea. Gallup's latest poll, released last week, showed his approval rating falling to 19%, per a poll of 1,000 adults. The unexpected declaration of martial law was also said to have caught the Biden administration by surprise. South Korea is a key US ally in the Indo-Pacific region and is a base for roughly 28,500 American service members, as well as numerous civilian workers and dependents. ""We continue to expect political disagreements to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement after the martial law was rescinded. Markets reacted immediately to South Korea's political crisis, with US-listed Korean stocks and the South Korean won taking a hit in overnight trade. While shares of Samsung Electronics, the country's largest company, dropped 3% before paring losses, South Korea's Kospi Index fell 2.2% and closed 1.4% lower on Wednesday. South Korean authorities have rushed to reassure investors. The country's finance ministry said on Wednesday it was standing ready to deploy all necessary measures to stabilize the financial markets. ""We will inject unlimited liquidity into stocks, bonds, short-term money market as well as forex market for the time being until they are fully normalised,"" the ministry said in a statement. On Wednesday, Kim Byung-hwan, the chairman of South Korea's Financial Services Commission, said the government was ready to activate a $35.4 billion stock market stabilization fund immediately and take other measures to address market concerns if needed. But Rhee Chang-yong, governor of the Bank of Korea, told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday evening local time that South Korea's financial markets were stabilizing quickly and that the impact on markets was short-lived. He added that he believed South Korea's economic dynamics can be separated from its political dynamics. Even so, a few hours later, the OECD lowered South Korea's 2025 growth economic outlook to 2.1%, from 2.2%. One notable stock surge amid all the turmoil: Kakao, and subsidiaries Kakaopay and KakaoBank, were up on Wednesday. Billionaire founder Brian Kim was arrested in July on charges of manipulating a major K-pop agency deal last year.",BusinessInsider,Lean Left,1081,"Lean Left  
The article presents a critical view of President Yoon Suk Yeol's actions, highlighting protests, opposition calls for impeachment, and widespread public discontent.

298,US Supreme Court could allow broader curbs on transgender rights,"Dec 5 (Reuters) - During arguments at the U.S. Supreme Court in this week's major transgender rights case, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor told the lawyer defending Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming medical care for people under age 18 that courts have a historic role in protecting minorities from discrimination. ""When you're 1 percent of the population or less, (it is) very hard to see how the democratic process is going to protect you,"" Sotomayor told Tennessee Solicitor General Matthew Rice during Wednesday's arguments, referring to the transgender population. Sotomayor's observation underscored key legal issues in the dispute - the role of U.S. courts to serve as a check on the legality of actions by legislatures and the level of scrutiny they should apply to laws under legal challenge. The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, appeared ready to uphold Tennessee's Republican-backed law, which was challenged by President Joe Biden's administration and other plaintiffs but was affirmed by a lower court. The administration wants the justices to conclude that the ban represents unlawful discrimination based on sex, which under Supreme Court precedent would trigger tougher judicial review and make is harder to defend under the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection. But the lower court rejected that approach. Instead, it used what is called a rational-basis review merely requiring a rational connection between a law and a legitimate state interest. A ruling by the Supreme Court using the rational-basis approach to uphold Tennessee's law, according to legal experts, could make it easier to defend a broader array of measures targeting transgender people, from bathroom use to sports participation, and extend even to restrictions on adults. The Tennessee law bans medical treatments such as puberty blockers and hormones for adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, the clinical diagnosis for significant distress that can result from an incongruence between a person's gender identity and the sex assigned at birth. Some of the conservative justices emphasized an ongoing debate among experts and policy makers over the potential benefits and risks of the treatments, suggesting the need for deference to elected legislators to make policy. ""If the court holds that discrimination against transgender people does not constitute sex discrimination and does not otherwise qualify for heightened scrutiny under the equal protection clause, then equal protection challenges to other forms of anti-trans governmental discrimination will be tough to win,"" said Paul Smith, a Georgetown University law professor who has argued many cases at the Supreme Court including a landmark gay rights victory in 2003. Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that certain European countries that he said have been at the forefront of youth transgender care policy are ""pumping the brakes"" on these treatments. In light of this, Kavanaugh signaled hesitance about having the Supreme Court ""constitutionalize the whole area."" Liberal justices expressed alarm that the court would not scrutinize legislative choices to ensure that they are not merely aimed at harming a disfavored minority group. ""What's really going on here is discrimination against - a disregard for - young people who are trans,"" liberal Justice Elena Kagan said. Some legal experts said wider implications of favoring Tennessee in the case would depend on the rationale expressed in the eventual ruling, expected by the end of June. Tennessee has argued that the ban is based on the treatment's medical purpose, not the patient's sex. If the court decides that laws making ""biologically rooted distinctions"" between individuals are not subject to tougher judicial review, for instance, ""then there might still be heightened scrutiny for distinctions that are more distant from biology as such, like bathrooms and sports,"" said University of Mississippi School of Law professor Christopher Green, who filed a legal brief backing Tennessee. This law is among numerous measures pursued in recent years, primarily in Republican-led states, concerning LGBT rights including limits on discussions of sexual orientation or gender identity in public schools, reinforcing sex-separated spaces like bathrooms in public places, and participation by transgender athletes in women's sports. Though Tennessee's law targets transgender adolescents, a ruling upholding it could make it easier for legislatures to impose restrictions on transgender adults as well. ""If the court finds that there is no sex classification involved in (the ban), it seems hard to imagine they would find one in a ban on gender-affirming medical care for adults,"" said lawyer Karen Loewy of the LGBT rights group Lambda Legal, which helped represent transgender minors and their parents who challenged the law. Upholding the lower court's ruling could ""do serious harm to decades of sex-discrimination law, which has required heightened scrutiny for any law rooted in overbroad generalizations about men and women,"" Loewy said. On Wednesday, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, arguing for Biden's administration, urged the justices to adopt the tougher judicial review. ""Maybe the states will ban medical care for adults who are transgender, maybe they'll ban adoption by transgender people or not allow them to be teachers,"" Prelogar said. ""That doesn't look anything like the workaday economic regulation that just gets rational-basis review."" Rice said that to the extent that a law dealing with adults would pass rational-basis review, ""that just means it's left to the democratic process - and that democracy is the best check on potentially misguided laws."" The administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who as a candidate advocate restricting transgender rights, could reverse the position taken by Biden's administration. Were that to occur, the court still might decide the case given that other challengers to the law also argued on Wednesday.",Reuters,Center,917,"Lean Left  
The article leans left as it prominently features perspectives from liberal justices and advocates for stronger protections for transgender individuals while quoting them in opposition to conservative views and legislation. It highlights concerns regarding discrimination against a minority group and emphasizes the role of the courts in safeguarding these rights. While it provides information on both sides, the focus on the ramifications of potential rulings that would restrict transgender rights suggests a bias toward supporting those rights."

The casings had the words “deny,” “defend,” and “depose” written on them, according to police sources speaking with several outlets. The messages leave hints as to the shooter’s motive. This still image from surveillance video obtained by the Associated Press shows the suspect, left, sought in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, center, outside a Manhattan hotel where the health insurer was holding an investor conference on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. (AP Photo) The bullet casing messages hint at bitterness over the practices of UnitedHealthcare or the healthcare industry generally. The phrase is popular in the insurance industry, according to CNN. Social media users drew a possible link between the bullet casing messages and the 2010 book Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don’t Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It by Jay M. Feinman. According to the book’s Amazon description, it serves as “an expose of insurance injustice and a plan for consumers and lawmakers to fight back,” claiming that the denial of “valid” insurance claims is “the result of an increasing and systematic focus on maximizing profits by major companies.” Police sources told ABC News that police may be closing in on the suspect and have obtained a search warrant for a location where he may have been staying. Detectives and experts believe the suspect wasn’t a professional killer, citing his mannerisms and apparent weapons jam. “This is not a professional killer, a contract killer by his mannerisms and by the failure of the weapon. I think when you start looking at all the video footage and you see the malfunction of the weapon with the noise-suppression unit causing a major malfunction, this is not the sign of a hired killer,” Zeke Unger, a liaison to the U.S. Marshals, told CNN. Police recovered three 9 mm rounds and shell cases at the scene, suggesting that his repeated clearing of the gun was due to malfunctions, as is common in pistols for which a silencer isn’t attached to a Nielsen Device. The apparent malfunctions suggest he wasn’t a professional hitman. According to the New York City Police Department and released surveillance footage, Thompson was shot multiple times at 6:46 a.m. outside the New York Hilton Midtown, where he was headed to a UnitedHealthcare investor conference. His assassin was wearing a black hooded jacket and a backpack and wielding a silenced pistol. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called the shooting a “brazen, targeted attack” and “premeditated.” A $10,000 reward was quickly put out for information regarding the suspect. Police are vigorously combing over surveillance footage to track down the suspect. So far, aside from the footage of the shooting, police have found footage of the man at a Starbucks shortly before and footage of him escaping on a bike afterward. His face is covered in all the footage.

45,The Syrian Civil War Has Come Alive After Years of Being Dormant. What’s Happening?,"The resumption of large-scale fighting in Syria’s civil war affirms, once more, the wisdom of the Irish poet William Butler Yeats, who wrote that when “Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, / The blood-dimmed tide is loosed.” In Syria’s case, the region’s security arrangements fell apart, the delicate balance of power could not hold, and so the strongest of the country’s armed militias rushed into the resulting void, unleashing a blood-dimmed tide along the way. Which is to say: Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah—Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s main allies, which have kept him in power for the past decade by helping him bomb, strafe, and otherwise crush a variety of rebel groups (along with much of the general population)—are now gravely weakened or preoccupied elsewhere. Last week, the strongest of these rebel groups, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (known as HTS), exploited Assad’s isolation by going on the offensive, taking control of Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city, and is now on the verge of capturing Hama, a crucial point on the route by which Assad has received arms from Hezbollah and Iran. For the moment, Assad is still safe. Damascus, the capital, is 115 miles from Hama. But the Syrian army collapsed with surprising ease, with many troops deserting the battlefield, in the face of the HTS rebels’ onslaught. Russia sent a few planes to bomb the rebel positions, but not many and, so far, to little effect; the Russian deployments in Syria were also overrun (the commanding officer has since reportedly been fired). Iran’s ministry of foreign affairs condemned the assault as “terrorism,” but it has done little to help. Their predicaments are clear. Russia’s military is stretched thin by the war in Ukraine. (It is now reliant on former underlings, importing drones from Iran and rockets—as well as 10,000 troops—from North Korea.) Iran is weakened in two ways. First, Hezbollah, which has acted as its main agent in helping Syria, has been decimated in recent battles with Israel. Second, Iran itself is nearing economic collapse, which has compelled Tehran’s leaders to seek renewed contact with the West. The collapse of Syria’s network isn’t the only cause of the rebels’ surge. In the 13 years of the country’s civil war, Assad, his army, and his allies have killed more than 500,000 of his own citizens, many of them peaceful pro-democracy activists. He has little support among the civilian population. Assad’s policies, combined with Western sanctions, have impoverished the country. Even his soldiers, 100,000 of whom have been killed or wounded in the fighting, are short on supplies, which could explain why they so quickly ran from fighting. So, who are the rebels of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham? Should we be rooting for them? Reports are mixed and at times contradictory, perhaps in part because with all the wars going on in the Middle East, the Syrian civil war—which has been relatively dormant in the past few years—has escaped the attention of many journalists and analysts in the region. The group was once affiliated with al-Qaida. Its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, cut ties with the terrorist group some years ago, saying he wanted to attain international legitimacy, in part so that he could step up as leader of Syria’s myriad rebel groups—some of them Kurds, some Sunni Arabs, most of them having little in common ideologically. Still, HTS remains a Salafi Jihadist group, and the United States and U.K. still consider it a “terrorist organization,” meaning it cannot be given assistance. President Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told CNN on Sunday that he won’t “cry over the fact that the Assad government—backed by Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah—are facing certain kinds of pressure,” though he added that there are “",SLATE,Left,1100,"Lean Left  
The article demonstrates a Lean Left bias as it presents a critical perspective of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his allies, attributing significant responsibility for the violence and humanitarian crisis to their actions. The mention of Western sanctions as contributing to Syria's impoverishment and the portrayal of rebel groups may indicate a sympathy towards democratic ideals, aligning with a more progressive stance. However, the analysis includes factual reporting on the conflict without overt partisanship, suggesting a moderate left perspective rather than an extreme one."
58,CEO’s murder provokes 'dark' humor in response to America’s 'dysfunctional healthcare system',"In the early morning hours of Wednesday, December 4, 2024, UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson was shot dead by a masked gunman who remains at large. On social media, his murder was met not with an outpouring of mourning, but ridicule. In an article published by Science publication Futurism, writer Victor Tangermann explored the ""incredibly dark"" responses to Thompson's killing on platforms like X and Bluesky.

Many of the memes circulating in response to Thompson's murder invoke the cold nature of the private health insurance industry, in which an insured's claim can be denied even if it's for filling a prescription for medication prescribed by their doctor or for treatment necessary to save someone's life. LendingTree's ValuePenguin wrote that UnitedHealth is the worst offender, denying roughly one-third of all in-network claims (32%), which is double the industry average of 16%. UnitedHealth has also been accused in a lawsuit of using artificial intelligence (AI) to deny claims filed by Medicare Advantage patients. The plaintiffs claim that the company had knowledge that the AI it was using ""had a high potential for error,"" and that UnitedHealth employees were pressured by supervisors to use the algorithm to issue denials. They were also reportedly told to keep patient stays within 1% of the length of stay predicted by the AI. The New York Post recently reported that Thompson and several UnitedHealth executives were under investigation by the Department of Justice for alleged insider trading. Thompson and three others allegedly sold more than $101 million in shares before news of the investigation was announced, which resulted in the company's stock price declining. Thompson himself reportedly made $15 million on the sale.

The article critiques the healthcare system and the private insurance industry, highlighting systemic failures and public disdain, which are common themes in left-leaning narratives. The use of dark humor in the context of a CEO's murder suggests a broader frustration with capitalist structures, particularly in healthcare, aligning with leftist critiques of profit motives in essential services. Additionally, the focus on social media responses reflects a tendency to spotlight progressive societal issues and the impact of corporate behavior on public welfare."
215,Black Republicans feel left out of Trump’s 2nd-term picks,"As President-elect Donald Trump fills out his Cabinet and chooses his closet advisers ahead of Inauguration Day, many African American leaders are asking why more Black people haven't been appointed to key positions. ABC News spoke to more than a half dozen longtime and new African American conservatives and Republicans within Trumpworld, in and outside of Washington. Last month, the president-elect appointed Scott Turner, who was executive director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council during Trump's first term, to serve as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. One area of frustration for many Black Republicans was speculation that if Trump did nominate an African American to his administration, it would be at HUD, the department that has had the most Black secretary appointments of any. One Black Southern Republican told ABC News, ""Why is every Black person given HUD?"" adding that it was ""the literal Black job of the administration."" ABC News reached out to Trump’s transition team for comment on his selections but did not get a reply. Six African Americans have served as HUD secretaries, including Robert Weaver, the first. His appointment in 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson also made him the first African American appointed to a Cabinet-level position. The first African American woman to serve in a presidential cabinet was Patricia Roberts Harris, who was the first African American Health and Human Services director and later HUD secretary. She served under President Jimmy Carter. Former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce was the only Black Cabinet official in the Ronald Reagan administration. Dr. Ben Carson at HUD was Trump's sole Black cabinet member in his first term. In mid-November, Carson posted that he was ""excited to speak with President Trump about how I will continue to advance the America First agenda, and I am meeting with him in the near future."" ""However, contrary to reports, I will not be serving as the Surgeon General,"" he said. The departments of Treasury and Interior remain the only departments that have never had a Black secretary. Another key position Black conservatives believe needs to be filled by an African American is assistant to the president, a senior-level role within the White House. Trump previously appointed Omarosa Manigault Newman, a contestant on his ""The Apprentice"" TV series, as the sole Black assistant to the president. ""I do think if you're really talking about Black influence inside the White House, does Trump want his only legacy of having the only AP for two terms be Omarosa?"" one Black Republican strategist asked. After Newman's departure, Ja'Ron Smith served as a special assistant on legislative affairs before rising to deputy assistant to the president for domestic policy. Ashley Bell, a prominent Black Republican, served as a White House adviser on entrepreneurship and a regional administrator for the Small Business Administration. Bell's former boss is former SBA Administrator Linda McMahon, who Trump announced as his pick for the Department of Education. McMahon also is co-chair of the Trump-Vance transition team. Some of the former president's most ardent defenders have grown restless with the lack of Black appointees, as Trump selected several others who would be firsts in those positions. If confirmed, Sen. Marco Rubio would be the first Hispanic secretary of state; Scott Bessent would be the first openly gay Treasury secretary; and Tulsi Gabbard will be the first Asian American and youngest-ever director of national intelligence. ""I can't tweet that we need more Black conservatives because the left will attack me saying it's a DEI hire,"" the southern Republican said. However, one Black Republican operative told ABC News it is still very early when it comes to appointments. ""The Republican Party has never really fallen into the category of 'representation matters.' Our strength comes from diversity, but that is not our bumper sticker slogan. We're not going to nominate Black folks for the sake of nominating Black people,"" the Republican operative said. The operative noted that Black Republicans have made strides in leadership across the country. Sen. Tim Scott will chair the National Republican Senatorial Committee; Rep. Byron Donald is speculated as possibly running for governor or U.S. Senate in Florida; and Winsome Sears is seeking to become the first Black female governor in the country in Virginia. Donalds on CNN last month took aim at President Joe Biden’s focus on diversity within his administration when asked about the lack of diversity among Trump’s nominees, saying “if you look at how the Democrats filled Joe Biden's cabinet, they wanted to have a piece of every identity. But did they get the job done? Did they actually serve the interest of the American people?"" ""What Donald Trump's election is about, is bringing competency and reality back to D.C. in the White House, regardless of their race, regardless of their religion, regardless of their creed."" the Florida congressman added. Although some Black leaders inside and out of politics are highly qualified, another barrier that Black conservatives face is added scrutiny because of their dual identity. Dedrick Asante-Muhammad, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a non-partisan organization that studies diversity in government and congressional staff, said that the Trump administration differs vastly from past Republican administrations. ""Trump isn't a traditional Republican, he doesn't use traditional Republican institutions in the same way that past presidential candidates have, so there isn't a kind of pipeline, long-term relations,"" Asante-Muhammad said. ""Being a part of Trumpworld isn't easy. It is almost a personal blacklist thing in the outside world. So it is risky, in my opinion, to be a part of this organization for Black people that may want to be a part of the cause, but it's not worth their bottom dollar,"" one Black Republican strategist added. ""When Black people are put underneath this microscope of being Trump-affiliated, they look past your color and you are public enemy number one,"" a Black Republican operative said. The Republican strategist said Black Republicans face a different set of expectations -- they don't necessarily thrive in spaces that are massively disruptive, such as the second Trump term. ""I don't think disruption really leans into our skillset the way things are currently set up, we have to play things a little bit differently. There's no Black Republican version of Matt Gatez. They don't last,"" the strategist added. ""Those of us who have survived and been there for years and made it work have done so by being steady, consistent, reliable, and trustworthy, "" the strategist said.",ABC,Lean Left,1081,"Lean Left  
The article reflects concerns from Black Republicans regarding their perceived exclusion from Trump's cabinet picks, suggesting a critique of Trump's administration. The language used showcases frustrations that align with broader narratives around diversity and representation, common themes in left-leaning media. The mention of scrutiny from “the left” also hints at an awareness of the ideological divide, suggesting a leaning toward a perspective that is critical of Trump’s choices, which is more characteristic of left-of-center analysis."
95,Repugnant Outburst In New Zealand Parliament Proves ‘Native’ Cultures Should Be Assimilated,"A recent video from New Zealand’s House of Representatives proves that some aspects of “native” culture truly belong in the dustbin of history. The video, which went viral Thursday, showed a group of Maori (“indigenous”) members of the New Zealand House of Representatives screaming, chanting, and generally causing mayhem in the House chamber in response to the mere idea that a bill they didn’t like would come up for a vote. This meltdown took place because the country’s parliament is considering a bill to reinterpret the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, one of New Zealand’s foundational documents. The treaty established the British Crown’s sovereignty over New Zealand in exchange for broad protections of Maori lands and rights. ACT New Zealand, the party that introduced the new bill, argues that in the last few decades the principles outlined in the treaty have been used to grant extra privileges, like ethnic quotas in public institutions, to the Maori. ACT’s bill would extend the rights outlined in the treaty to all New Zealanders, regardless of race. Of course, the Maori and their leftist allies screamed (literally) that this bill would strip away the Maori’s fundamental right to special treatment. After multiple interruptions of House Speaker Gerry Brownlee as he tried to move the chamber to a party vote, Member of Parliament Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke began a ritualistic war chant and dance, called a haka, by ripping up a copy of the bill Nancy Pelosi-style. Soon a mob of parliament members and onlookers in the balcony joined Maipi-Clarke in the fracas, completely drowning out any attempts to restore order in the chamber. They even approached David Seymour, the leader of ACT, as they performed the chant in a clear attempt to intimidate him, the Associated Press reported. Parliament suspended after floor-shaking haka by Te Pāti Māori pic.twitter.com/K6FJkNLL7T Brownlee temporarily suspended the house and expelled two lawmakers, including Maipi-Clarke, from the chamber. Eventually, the bill passed its first reading, but it will almost certainly fail in future votes. The “appallingly disrespectful” spectacle was led by members of the Maori-centric party Te Pāti Māori. The party extols explicitly Marxist positions, advocating for Maori “liberation” and endorsing redistributive economic policies. On Thursday, Te Pāti Māori successfully liberated the New Zealand House chamber from the rules-based parliamentary procedure that allows Western-style democratic governments to function without descending into complete anarchy. The ritualistic dance the House members performed, the haka, has a grisly history, as do the Maori themselves. Before the arrival of the British, the Maori routinely engaged in ritual cannibalism and human sacrifice, mostly related to warfare. A tribe’s warriors would perform the haka, go off to fight, and then consume the flesh of slain enemies afterward. In fact, the very haka performed by the House members on Thursday (the title of which translates to “It is death”) was created by a Maori chief who had escaped capture and consumption by an enemy tribe. Though the Maori and leftist scholars have tried to downplay (and still do) the frequency and significance of cannibalism in Maori culture for decades, New Zealand historian Paul Moon extensively documented instances of cannibalism in his book This Horrid Practice, drawing on European accounts going back to the legendary Captain James Cook in the 1770s. Moon also noted that the Maori practiced infanticide. Their warrior culture prized male babies, so mothers would sometimes smother female infants or push their fingers through the soft part of their skulls. As they did elsewhere in the world, the British extirpated cannibalism and human sacrifice in New Zealand after the Treaty of Waitangi to such an extent that many historians doubted that the practices had taken place at all. Maori revisionists have claimed that the haka can represent a greeting or a “celebration of life,” but any rational observer can conclude that the Te Pāti Māori members did not intend their Thursday haka as a greeting or celebration. The AP characterized the stunt as a “rare outburst of protest” and, of course, other leftist outlets framed it as a brave demonstration against injustice, but this kind of behavior more resembles a tantrum from frustrated children. It should go without saying that this display, with its explicitly violent undertones, is wholly unacceptable in a modern state. It also elucidates the fact that the brute force culture of many “indigenous” groups runs directly counter to the tradition of decorum found in Western government as well as the principles of debate, deliberation, and compromise. Instead of compromising with the “natives” and allowing them to masquerade as a “marginalized” group to get more handouts, the British should have done more to both acknowledge Maori culture was morally repugnant and fully assimilate them into English culture. In the long-term, their full assimilation would have avoided almost all of the problems the Maori currently face and would allow the country’s House of Representatives to actually function properly. And it’s not impossible to assimilate foreign cultures. The United States did it very successfully up until a few decades ago — when we made the conscious decision to stop trying. European history has seen dozens if not hundreds of cultures assimilated (see any culture that fell under Roman hegemony). All it takes is the confidence that your culture is more moral and more dedicated to the improvement of human life. When the culture you’re trying to assimilate is engaging in or glorifying cannibalism and human sacrifice, that shouldn’t be a hard stance to take. The Maori protest on Thursday broke out because they felt threatened by the idea that they would have to share their heretofore exclusive privileges with their fellow countrymen — that their rights would be assimilated into the rest of the body politic. With the Treaty of Waitangi, the Maori arguably secured for themselves the best deal any “native” group ever struck with European settlers, yet they still portray themselves as perpetual victims. Because they were not assimilated, they’ll forever see themselves as outside of the culture that they live in, no matter how much Western governments give them. Regardless of how generously Westerners shower them with money or social programs or special reverence, they’ll always want more. Because they don’t want to assimilate. They want to cling to their aggrieved status forever and degrade Western society as much as possible as a means of revenge. We see the same pattern here in the United States. Perpetual victimhood serves as the lifeblood of the CRT scourge that has plagued academia and public education for the last few years. The ethnic quotas that evolved from the Treaty of Waitangi smack of the DEI programs and quotas that define modern, woke corporate America. So-called “marginalized” sections of the population want to receive government money and favor in the name of “restitution.” They then scream accusations of racism at reasonable people who threaten their perks by suggesting a system of equality of opportunity. Repudiating Maori culture and fully assimilating the Maori into Western culture would have benefitted all parties and avoided the shameful impudence shown toward the rules that facilitate good governance. By continuing to tolerate such open exhibitions of hostility, Westerners permit the degradation of their own culture.",Federalist,Right,1192,"Right  
This article exhibits a clear right-wing bias through its overt criticism of Maori culture and the assertion that indigenous peoples should assimilate into Western culture, dismissing their historical suffering and rights. The framing of the Maori protest as a ""tantrum"" and the call for their cultural practices to be discarded in favor of Western values reflect a traditional conservative viewpoint that prioritizes Western norms over indigenous rights. Additionally, the references to ""woke"" culture and criticisms of affirmative action resonate with right-leaning perspectives, reinforcing its classification."

354,Musk-led DOGE sparks ‘new day in America’ energy on Capitol Hill,"President-elect Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency was all the buzz Thursday on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers got their first taste of how the Elon Musk-led cost-cutting committee plans to shake up Washington. House Speaker Michael Johnson flashed his excitement by telling reporters that DOGE’s work marks a “new day in Washington and a new day in America.” “This is an important day — it is the beginning of a journey,” the Louisiana Republican said after meeting with Mr. Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the Trump allies tasked with weeding out government waste. “Let me be frank about this: Government is too big, it does too many things, and it does almost nothing well.” That deep-rooted sentiment among fiscal conservatives and small-government advocates feeds the excitement over DOGE’s potential to upend the big-spending consensus in Washington and usher in an era of accountability. Mr. Musk, with his son Lil X in tow, and Mr. Ramaswamy were given rock star treatment as they made their way through the corridors of Congress, flocked by staff, reporters and security. Social media was littered with Republican lawmakers posing for selfies with Mr. Musk and Mr. Ramaswamy, who met with the chairs of House and Senate committees, the heads of the newly formed bicameral DOGE caucuses, and a larger group of House and Senate Republicans. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican leading a DOGE subcommittee, said Mr. Musk delivered a crucial message. “He said something extremely important: Every single payment that the federal government pays out, we need to be checking those payments to see if they are legitimate,” Ms. Greene told reporters. “That is something that hasn’t been done.” She said Mr. Musk and Mr. Ramaswamy also floated the idea of a “naughty list” and a “nice list” for lawmakers based on their votes on federal spending. Rep. Aaron Bean, Florida Republican, said Mr. Musk and Mr. Ramaswamy received a standing ovation at their closed-door meeting and that their “naughty list” idea could have legs. “If we’re going to get out of the hole, we have to stop digging, yeah, and so we have to look at ourselves every time we pass a bill that’s not funded or paid for, we’re going the wrong way,” Mr. Bean said. The DOGE commission’s social media account has been highlighting wasteful and head-scratching ways the government tosses around taxpayer funds. Reports from conservative-leaning groups show that the National Institutes of Health spent $1.8 billion studying racism, including on “Promoting Color Brave Conversations in Families: A Public Health Strategy to Advance Racial Equity,” and more than $150 billion on illegal immigrants at the federal, state and local levels. They have cited reports from the Government Accountability Office estimating that $100 billion in improper payments were made in the Medicare and Medicaid programs in fiscal year 2023 and the Congressional Budget Office showing Congress allocated $516 billion for programs that had expired under federal law. One report said the Pentagon “can’t fully account for $824 Billion.” The jubilance on Capitol Hill belies a tough road ahead to changing Washington’s spending culture. Federal debt has topped $36 trillion and will soon reach the highest ratio of debt to gross domestic product in history. The previous record was set during World War II when the U.S. defeated two global adversaries and emerged with a strong economy and decreasing deficits. The government is projected to run trillion-dollar deficits for the foreseeable future. The fiscal picture has generated fears that the longer deficits and debt go unaddressed, the more likely the nation will spiral into an economic crisis. It is unclear what authority the new agency will have to implement cost-cutting recommendations. Mr. Musk has suggested that annual government spending cuts should equate to roughly $2 trillion. Another question is how far DOGE will go in tackling the biggest drivers of national spending — Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid — or whether it will target the Department of Defense, which has failed multiple audits. “They are looking at everything,” Mr. Bean said. What is clear is that congressional Republicans and a few Democrats are eager to get involved with DOGE. “There is a massive amount of waste, fraud and abuse that we have to tackle,” Ms. Greene said. “I’m looking forward to exposing every single unelected bureaucrat, every single agency that is wasting the American people’s money, and the big government departments that need to be exposed for how they are not serving the American people.” Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican who recently launched the Senate DOGE caucus, got the conversation rolling Thursday by releasing an “Out of Office” report highlighting how some federal employees have abused telework policies and turned government buildings into relative ghost towns. Only 6% of the federal workforce goes to the office daily. Ms. Ernst recommended returning federal employees to the workplace or eliminating the federal office buildings that are not being used by selling off properties or ending leases. “Use it or lose it,” Ms. Ernst said on Fox News.",WashingtonTimes,Lean Right,834,"Lean Right  
The article largely reflects a right-leaning perspective, emphasizing themes of government inefficiency, fiscal conservatism, and staff admiration for prominent Republicans like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. It champions efforts to reduce government spending, echoing sentiments typically associated with the Republican Party.

373,"University of Michigan Nixes Diversity Statements in Faculty Hiring, Promotion","The University of Michigan will no longer use diversity statements in faculty hiring, promotion, and tenure, joining a number of elite universities that are moving away from progressive identity politics in an effort to expand diversity of thought and free expression on campus. Provost Laurie McCauley announced the decision Thursday after an eight-member faculty working group recommended the university abolish diversity statements. While there was no institutional requirement for such statements, UM did implement the practice in its hiring decisions. “Diversity, equity and inclusion are three of our core values at the university. Our collective efforts in this area have produced important strides in opening opportunities for all people,” McCauley said in the University Record, an internal faculty publication. “As we pursue this challenging and complex work, we will continuously refine our approach.” In June, the provost charged the faculty working group with examining the university’s use of diversity statements. The group published its report on October 31 after reviewing literature on the topic and considering DEI policies at other universities and colleges. The group also conducted a survey of nearly 2,000 faculty, most of whom believe diversity statements “put pressure on faculty to express specific positions on moral, political or social issues,” per the University Record. Furthermore, a slight majority of respondents said soliciting diversity statements for hiring purposes does not demonstrate an institutional commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. “Critics of diversity statements perceive them as expressions of personal identity traits, support of specific ideology or opinions on socially-relevant issues, and serve as a ‘litmus test’ of whether a faculty member’s views are politically acceptable,” the working group concluded in its report. “Thus, as currently enacted, diversity statements have the potential to limit viewpoints and reduce diversity of thought among faculty members.” The group’s eight members also recommended the university incorporate DEI content into teaching, research, and service statements, as well as train faculty on how how to write and evaluate such content. UM did not enact those recommendations. The provost thanked the faculty working group for its comprehensive report. “I’m grateful for this faculty committee, which spent months soliciting feedback from across campus, evaluating our methods and determining the best course forward,” McCauley added. UM is the latest university to abandon diversity statements. Harvard University’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, both of which previously required job candidates to submit DEI statements, did the same this summer. The new policy follows the UM Board of Regents’ adoption of a policy on institutional neutrality that prevents university officials from making public statements on political and social issues unrelated to internal matters. The move prompted UM’s Faculty Senate to censure the regents for hastily committing to institutional neutrality before it could be reviewed by the Senate Assembly. “The Regents have little inclination to engage in shared governance and are increasingly exhibiting authoritarian tendencies antithetical to a public university in a democratic nation,” the faculty body wrote in its censure motion. The regents are scheduled to convene Thursday afternoon to discuss the university’s DEI spending and programs, Republican regent Sarah Hubbard told Fox & Friends on Sunday. The Board of Regents is not expected to vote on the provost’s decision regarding the end of diversity statements. The DEI ideology has become entrenched at UM in recent years, causing students and faculty to censor themselves for fear of offending others. National Review reported on the university’s DEI bureaucracy in 2022, investigating how certain speech is suppressed and punished for being politically incorrect. In one instance, members of a student veterans’ group joked about a female student’s sexual proclivity, which she joked about herself. Despite profuse apologies, the young woman approached the university with her concerns. A formal discrimination complaint followed, leading to a trial with witnesses and charges of misogyny and victim blaming.

The article reflects a lean right bias by critiquing diversity statements and emphasizing their potential to limit free expression and diversity of thought on campus. It presents the university's decision to abolish these statements in a positive light, aligning with conservative viewpoints that oppose the perceived overreach of progressive identity politics in academia. Furthermore, the portrayal of faculty concerns and the mention of censure highlight a narrative that suggests a struggle against authoritarian tendencies within the university governance, which resonates more with right-leaning ideologies."
52,"With 13 newcomers, South Carolina Senate may tackle tough issues","COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — With the largest number of newly elected members at least since World War II, Republican South Carolina Senate leaders are thinking about tackling some issues like tax reform that have long been too tough to handle. The 13 new senators — nine Republicans and four Democrats — came to the Statehouse on Wednesday to meet, give five-minute introductory speeches, get their committee assignments and pick their seats. The session doesn’t start for 40 more days. When it does begin, Republican Majority Leader Shane Massey wants to debate a bill to allow parents to spend public money on private schools, tweaking a law that was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court earlier this year. Massey wants the Senate — which now had a 34-12 Republican supermajority — to look into a broad bill rewriting South Carolina’s energy policy to ensure the rapidly growing state has enough power. There are criminal justice issues like fighting fentanyl and major retail theft and what many senators think is the growing problem with insurance rate spikes because the state’s liability laws don’t differentiate between levels of responsibility, Massey said. But all those new members could mean senators can go after items that have long met resistance like reforming the state’s entire tax system or retirement system or the civil lawsuit system. “I think there will be some dynamic changes,” Massey said of all the new senators. “The personalities are different.” But issues can wait until the session starts on Jan. 14. Wednesday was for housekeeping matters and introductions, with family watching their loved ones being sworn in There was one major rule change passed. The Senate President and Majority Leader now can sponsor a resolution to remove a chairman from a committee that will go before the Rules Committee and the entire Senate. There have been rumblings over the past few years about how some chairpersons, who are determined by seniority, handle their committees and the pace of legislation passed out of them. The rule sends a message to them about how they operate. Massey said he doesn’t expect the rule to ever be used, but it’s there as a safeguard. “We just want to make sure the committees are doing the work that they are tasked with doing and the majority is able to move legislation,” Massey said.",APNEWS,Left,389,"Center

70,"Democrat Jerry Nadler steps aside from top Judiciary role, avoiding party fight","WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep. Jerry Nadler announced Wednesday that he will be stepping down as the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee next year, avoiding an intra-party fight over a prominent position as the party prepares to confront a second Trump presidency. Nadler’s decision to relinquish control of the powerful committee came a day after fellow Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin announced his bid for the job and quickly amassed support from colleagues. “I am also proud that, under my leadership, some of our caucus’s most talented rising stars have been given a platform to demonstrate their leadership and their abilities,” Nadler wrote in the letter to Democrats that was obtained by The Associated Press. “That includes Jamie Raskin, who in just a few terms in Congress has already proven himself to be an exceptional leader and spokesperson for our party’s values.” The 77-year-old chose to step aside as the Democratic party undergoes an internal reckoning over their losses in the election, which swept Republicans into a trifecta of power in Washington. Many Democrats are eager for generational change and a new approach as President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. The decision by Nadler, who is serving his 17th term in Congress, reflects that generational shift. Before he made his decision Wednesday morning, Nadler spent time speaking with staff about what his next step should be. He also made a call to Raskin, which was described as cordial by a person familiar with the conversation who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. “Jerry Nadler is an extraordinary lawyer, patriot and public servant,” Raskin posted on X. “His dogged defense of civil rights and civil liberties is a great inspiration to our people.” He added, “I am honored and humbled to have his support in the battles ahead.” Democratic Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries also reached out to Nadler, according to the same person, and offered him an emeritus status on the Judiciary committee, an honorary title that recognizes a member’s seniority and service to the chamber. Nadler said he plans to stay on the committee as a senior member and will likely take up a ranking member role on one of the various subcommittees. But despite the cordial back-and-forth, the timeline of events that led to Raskin’s surprise bid and Nadler’s swift decision to step down damaged a close friendship between the two men. Nadler’s staff had expected that there would likely be a challenger for the ranking member spot. And a week before Thanksgiving, they heard that Raskin, a former constitutional law professor, was making the rounds, talking to Democratic colleagues about a potential run. Nadler, who ran the vote counting operation to successfully land Raskin the top spot on the House Oversight Committee, confronted the Maryland lawmaker, who denied he was making a play for the job, according to the same person. Raskin told him that he would soon put out a letter announcing that he would run for the Oversight post again. Raskin’s office did not respond to a request for comment. That letter never came and when Nadler inquired again about it days later, Raskin softened his stance, according to the person, saying that he was hearing from a lot of people that he should run. On Saturday, reports came out of Raskin pursuing the post before he made it official with a letter to colleagues on Monday. He wrote that the Judiciary Committee under his leadership would become “the headquarters of Congressional opposition to authoritarianism” as well as other efforts by Trump and his allies to thwart the Constitution. It was a stunning turn of events given that over the years Democrats have rarely broken from the seniority system for committee assignments, no matter how long someone has held a position, making the outcome of the race uncertain. But being the face of the resistance against Trump is not new territory for Raskin who spent the last two years on the House Oversight committee as the most vocal defender of President Joe Biden and his family as they faced a sprawling Republican investigation — encouraged by Trump — into their various business affairs. He also helped draft articles of impeachment against the incoming president for his encouragement of the violent mob on Jan. 6, 2021, and led the impeachment prosecution in the Senate. “As our country faces the return of Donald Trump, and the renewed threats to our democracy and our way of life that he represents, I am very confident that Jamie would ably lead the Judiciary Committee as we confront this growing danger,” Nadler wrote at the end of his letter. ___",APNEWS,Left,771,"Lean Left  
The article focuses on the Democratic party's internal dynamics and the implications of Jerry Nadler stepping aside from his leadership role, which reflects ongoing intra-party discussions pertinent to party ideology. It highlights the efforts of Democrats, particularly in confronting Republican leadership, and positions Jamie Raskin favorably within the context of party values. The overall tone supports Democratic perspectives, underscoring concern about a Trump presidency and framing potential leadership as a response to perceived authoritarianism, aligning with a Lean Left bias."

163,Key GOP senator says she's not ready to support Hegseth for defense secretary,"Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst said Thursday she isn't ready to support Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's choice for defense secretary. ""Well, I did have a very long, lengthy discussion with Pete yesterday, and I do appreciate his service to the nation. I also am a combat veteran. So, we talked about a number of those issues, and we will continue with the vetting process. I think that is incredibly important,"" Ernst told Fox News. ""So, again, all I'm saying is we had a very frank and productive discussion, and I know that we will continue to have conversations for months."" Pressed by host Bill Hemmer that it ""doesn't sound in your answer that you got to a yes,"" Ernst replied, ""I think you are right."" Hegseth continues to make the rounds on Capitol Hill to try to convince senators that he's up to the job amid allegations of sexual misconduct, alcohol abuse and mismanagement of finances. He denies the allegations. He met Wednesday with Ernst, a key Republican member of the Armed Services committee and herself a survivor of sexual assault. Upon leaving the meeting, Hegseth told reporters that he and Ernst had an ""engaging and instructive conversation."" Ernst later posted, ""I appreciate Pete Hegseth's service to our country, something we both share. Today, as part of the confirmation process, we had a frank and thorough conversation."" ABC News has previously reported Ernst to be on a growing list of candidates emerging to possibly replace Hegseth as Trump's pick to lead the Department of Defense. When asked Wednesday if there was any chance she was being considered to replace Hegseth, she merely responded, ""Mr. Hegseth is the nominee."" She was tight-lipped over whether their meeting alleviated any concerns she might have. Ernst is the first female combat veteran in the Senate. She also has a long record of supporting legislation aimed at addressing sexual assault and harassment in the military, and has been outspoken about her own experiences with sexual assault, rape, and domestic violence. Notably, Hegseth has said that women should not serve in combat roles in the military, and he continues to face his own allegations of sexual misconduct and impropriety. Hegseth has denied the sexual assault allegations. On Wednesday, he told the Megyn Kelly show ""absolutely not"" in regards to rape accusations, and he denied many of the claims that he mistreated women. All eyes will be on Ernst as Hegseth's confirmation process plays out. Last month, Ernst told ABC News that an FBI background check into Hegseth would be ""helpful."" In an interview with Bloomberg News in 2019, Ernst first disclosed the details of her rape as a college student at Iowa State University, in which she tearfully retold being in a ""physically and sexually abusive"" relationship with someone who raped her. During her college years, she volunteered at a safe house for battered and abused women and children. While speaking to Bloomberg, Ernst also alleged that her ex-husband, Gail Ernst, had physically abused her in an incident in which he ""grabbed [her] by the throat"" before he ""threw [her]"" on the ground and ""pounded [her] head."" Gail Ernst declined to comment on the allegations at the time. Ernst also claimed to have endured sexual harassment in the military, which she described to Time Magazine in 2014. ""I had comments, passes, things like that,"" Ernst said. ""These were some things where I was able to say stop and it simply stopped but there are other circumstances both for women and for men where they don't stop and they may be afraid to report it."" ""Sexual assault has no place in our military -- or anywhere else -- and it's far past time we take more steps toward preventing and reducing these heart-wrenching crimes,"" Ernst said in a statement after introducing a bipartisan bill in 2021 to prevent military sexual assault. Ernst was a member of Iowa State University's ROTC program at 20 years old before joining the U.S. Army Reserve. She later served as a company commander of an Iowa National Guard transportation unit in Kuwait. She spent 23 years in the National Guard and Army Reserve and retired as a lieutenant colonel. Ernst has been vocal about her support for Trump, despite him also having been accused of sexual assault by multiple women -- which he has repeatedly denied. Ernst was even a contender to be his running mate in the 2016 election. ""I would encourage women to stand up and say, 'You know what, I'm not going to put up with his nonsense, but I do agree with him on this policy,'"" Ernst said in a 2016 interview with WHO. ""Sometimes we have to look beyond certain aspects of a person and figure out do we agree."" She also told Bloomberg that it was ""outrageous to suggest that anyone who has been the victim of sexual assault should therefore be a Hillary Clinton supporter.""",ABC,Lean Left,821,"Center

372,Biden White House eyeing preemptive pardons to protect people from Trump,"President Biden and his top aides are tinkering with the idea of issuing preemptive pardons to individuals they fear will be targeted by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office. There is a running list of potential pardon recipients, senior Democrats familiar with the plans told Politico, a news website in Washington. One includes former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who was a member of the Jan. 6 committee that looked into the Capitol riot. She has been an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump and lost reelection in 2022 to a Trump-backed Republican candidate. She also backed Vice President Kamala Harris in this election cycle, as did her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney. Another Jan. 6 committee member on the list is Sen.-elect Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat. The committee’s final report recommended criminal charges against Mr. Trump. Anthony Fauci, who led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic, is also on the list. He received a lot of criticism from the right over his handling of the pandemic and rejection of the theory that the virus leaked from a lab in China, which is now widely accepted. Retired Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark A. Milley is also named, a source told ABC News. Gen. Milley, who held his position from 2019 to 2023, started to speak out against Mr. Trump during this election cycle, and in journalist Bob Woodward’s book, he called the president-elect a “fascist to the core.” He was also criticized by Republicans over the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. The considerations come after Mr. Biden announced a full pardon for his son Hunter Biden earlier this week. Hunter Biden’s pardon covers 11 years of any crimes he committed. The pardon received backlash from Republicans and Democrats, but Mr. Biden said he did it because “in trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me — and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here.” Mr. Biden and his aides aren’t the only ones who have thought this may be necessary. Rep. Brendan Boyle, Pennsylvania Democrat, called for Mr. Biden to issue blanket pardons. “This is no hypothetical threat,” Mr. Boyle said in a statement Wednesday. “The people they’re targeting include law enforcement officers, military personnel, and others who have spent their lives protecting this country. These patriots shouldn’t have to live in fear of political retribution for doing what’s right. That’s why I’m urging President Biden to issue a blanket pardon for anyone unjustly targeted by this vindictive scheme.” “The time for cautious restraint is over,” he said. “We must act with urgency to push back against these threats and prevent Trump from abusing his power.” Mr. Trump has many times railed against his political enemies and the “deep state,” and he has made suggestive comments about going after them.",WashingtonTimes,Lean Right,474,"Lean Left  
This article reflects a Lean Left bias as it portrays the Biden administration's possible actions positively, suggesting a protective motive against perceived political retribution by Donald Trump. The references to Trump and the mention of significant criticism he has received indicate a more critical stance towards him and his allies. The favorable depiction of Democratic figures, such as Liz Cheney and Adam Schiff, further suggests an alignment with progressive perspectives and concerns about Trump's influence. Overall, the narrative leans toward defending Biden's and the Democrats' actions against right-wing critiques."
328,Canada bans 324 varieties of guns: ‘These firearms can no longer be used’,"OTTAWA, Ontario — Canada said Thursday it is outlawing another 324 firearm varieties - guns the public safety minister said belong on the battlefield, not in the hands of hunters or sport shooters. Ottawa also said it is working with the government of Ukraine to see how the guns can be donated to support the fight against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The move follows the May 2020 ban of 1,500 makes and models of firearms, a number that grew to more than 2,000 by November of this year as new variants were identified. The latest restriction, announced Thursday by Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, follows expressions of concern from gun-control advocates that many assault-style firearms were not included in the 2020 ban. “This means these firearms can no longer be used,” LeBlanc said. Defense Minister Bill Blair said Canada approached Ukrainian authorities, who expressed interest in some of the guns. “Every bit of assistance we can offer to the Ukrainians is one step toward their victory,” Blair said. The federal government says it is working with provinces, territories and police on a planned buyback of prohibited weapons from individual owners. Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada, but the newly announced measures come on the eve of the 35th anniversary of the École Polytechnique in Montreal, where a gunman killed 14 women before killing himself. The Ruger Mini-14 used by the gunman, Marc Lepine, was among the weapons included in the 2020 ban. Nathalie Provost, a survivor who was wounded in the attack, said Thursday she was targeted for being a woman studying engineering. “These are just killing weapons, war weapons, military weapons, so I’m proud we are doing something,” Provost said. Canada has had far fewer mass shootings than the U.S. in part because of a lack of easy access to guns, though the U.S. population also is far larger than Canada’s. Officials have acknowledged guns smuggled into Canada illegally are often used by criminals. Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre called the announcement a “stunt” by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government that attacks “licensed & law-abiding hunters and sport shooters.”",WashingtonTimes,Lean Right,352,"Lean Left  
The article emphasizes gun control measures taken by the Canadian government, framing them as necessary for public safety and supported by gun control advocates. It highlights quotes from officials and advocates who characterize the banned firearms as military weapons while presenting the opposition's views in a less favorable light. The focus on a progressive response to gun violence and the collaboration with Ukraine further indicates a left-leaning perspective."
201,Voters elected the most closely divided House since the Great Depression and WWI,"There’s been a recent effort to brand the White House as “The People’s House,” which seems very wrong since the president is picked by the complicated Electoral College rather than directly by voters. It’s the House of Representatives that is closest to the American people and most directly represents their will. With the last House race of the 2024 election decided – by fewer than 200 votes! – we can say definitively that Congress, like the political divide in the US, will change very little. The same electorate that returned Donald Trump to the White House with a smidge less than 50% of the vote – a decision that could have a great effect on American life when he takes control of the federal bureaucracy – has also delivered the most narrowly divided House since the outset of the Great Depression, with Republicans holding a slim majority. That means if the president-elect and his GOP allies don’t find a way to work across the aisle, they’ll have to rely on complete agreement among Republicans in the House. In either scenario, they’ll likely have a hard time enacting much permanent change in American law. That final contested House race will be won by Adam Gray, a pickup for Democrats in California’s Central Valley. The movement in this year’s House elections looked like this: Democrats picked up nine seats and lost eight. Republicans picked up eight seats and lost nine. The balance of power would be Republicans’ 220 to Democrats’ 215 when the new Congress takes the oath of office on January 3, but up to three Republican seats are likely to be open by later in the month. Former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida resigned from Congress when he was briefly Trump’s nominee to be attorney general. And Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York and Mike Waltz of Florida are both expected to leave Congress to join Trump’s administration as the president-elect’s picks for US ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser, respectively. That means the true balance, at least to start the two-year legislative term if all three seats are vacant at once, will be 217-215. Republicans will have to be in lockstep to be able to pass anything without help from Democrats, which is the party’s preference. “Do the math; we have nothing to spare,” House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters of his historically slim majority. Trump, meanwhile, will work through the White House with executive orders and rulemaking to enact less permanent change. But Johnson predicted he will be able to maneuver Trump’s controversial agenda through the House: “We know how to work in a small majority here; that’s our custom.” The GOP’s slight edge next year will essentially be a continuation of the past two years, when Republicans held only a slightly larger majority of 222 to 213 after the midterm elections. Two years before that? Democrats had the majority﻿, with a very similar 222 to 212 balance. That pattern is a symptom of the country’s division but also reflects the lack of competitive districts due to gerrymandering. Incumbents usually win reelection. Only 17 of 435 seats, less than 4% of the House, went from one party to the other in the 2024 election. It’s been 16 years, since the election of Barack Obama as president in 2008, that either party has had a true government majority of more than 250 seats in the House, something that used to be relatively common. The last time a minority in the House had 215 or more votes was after the 1930 midterm elections, when Republicans had 218 to Democrats’ 216 and the Farmer-Labor Party had one. But there’s an interesting footnote. Back then, there were 13 months between the election and the first day of the new Congress. In that time, 14 congressmen-elect died, including then-House Speaker Nicholas Longworth. Ensuing special elections handed a slim majority to Democrats. Two years later, a wave of voters hurting from the Great Depression would elect Franklin D. Roosevelt as president and the Democratic Congress that would enact the New Deal. Look for Democrats to seize on any openings that develop during the coming Congress. Another nearly tied Congress, convened at the outset of US involvement in World War I in 1917, followed years in which Democrats had been more comfortably in control. House members can take office at the age of 25, five years earlier than senators and a decade earlier than the president. Unlike the president, members of Congress don’t need to be natural born citizens, which means many more Americans are eligible for the job. House representatives are chosen by direct elections rather than the antiquated Electoral College, and they’re up for election every two years, instead of four like the president or six like senators. They’re also more representative since their districts are meant to be relatively equal in population, unlike in the Senate, where small states get the same number of votes as large states. “Here, sir, the people govern: Here they act by their immediate representatives,” Alexander Hamilton said of the House, selling the Constitution to fellow New Yorkers. The country has changed a lot in the centuries since he said those words. The House, where laws are supposed to originate, has been wracked by gridlock and has ceded some authority to the president. But it remains the most democratic part of the American experiment. And this year, it’s still divided.",CNN,Lean Left,906,"Center

253,Florida woman who led a nearly $200 million Ponzi scheme sentenced to 20 years in prison,"A Florida woman who pleaded guilty in a Ponzi scheme that raked in nearly $200 million was sentenced Tuesday to 20 years in prison. Johanna Garcia, 41, of Broward County, received the maximum possible sentence for one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud. Twenty-eight other counts from her indictment were dismissed, according to court filings in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Judge Jose Martinez also sentenced Garcia to three years of supervised release and a $100 special assessment, plus additional restitution that will be determined March 3, according to the case docket. Garcia controlled MJ Capital Funding, which fraudulently solicited investors to fund its purported business of providing short-term, high-cost loans called merchant cash advances, or MCAs, federal prosecutors said in a press release. She and her co-conspirators made “false statements and fraudulent representations” to investors about the nature of their investment and how the money would be used, the prosecutors said. Investors were told that their money would fund MCAs and that returns on their investment would be paid from the profits of the MCA business. Garcia and her co-conspirators falsely promised significant returns at an annual rate of 120%, according to the indictment. But her company “made few loans and failed to earn anywhere near the profits it needed to pay the investors the promised returns,” prosecutors said in Tuesday’s release. “As a result, Garcia paid investors by running a large Ponzi fraud scheme, paying existing investors using new investor funds while misappropriating millions of dollars for her own personal benefit.” The fraudulent conspiracy, which took place between October 2020 and August 2021, netted at least $190.7 million. Of that total, investors lost nearly $90 million, prosecutors said. In 2021, investors in MJ Capital filed a lawsuit accusing Wells Fargo Bank of aiding the fraud scheme by failing to follow its own anti-money-laundering policies. The bank in March 2023 agreed to settle the suit for $26.6 million. Garcia’s partner, Pavel Ramon Ruiz Hernandez, was charged in August 2022 and pleaded guilty in April 2023 to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He was sentenced in September 2023 to nine years and two months in prison, plus three years of supervised release. Prosecutors said Tuesday that after MJ Capital was shut down by the FBI and the Securities and Exchange Commission, Garcia, Ruiz Hernandez and others launched a new, similar Ponzi scheme in fall 2021. Garcia led this new scheme from its start, “up until her arrest [in August 2023], and after, while in Bureau of Prisons custody,” according to prosecutors. The new scheme — using entities called New Beginning Global Funding LLC and New Beginning Capital Funding LLC, among others — involved Garcia and her partners telling investors that they would be funding commercial loans. “In truth, the money raised was used to pay off previous investors, and fund Garcia and her coconspirators’ lifestyles,” prosecutors said. In a Nov. 27 sentencing memo, Garcia’s attorneys suggested that Ruiz Hernandez was effectively the true leader of the scheme. They also argued that Garcia’s subsequent conduct through New Beginning, “though deeply misguided and plainly wrong, was motivated by a desire to pay back her former investors.” The U.S. Attorney’s Office, in its own memo filed Monday, rejected that characterization and urged the judge to sentence Garcia to 240 months’ imprisonment. “The evidence overwhelmingly shows that Garcia was the leader/organizer of the two Ponzi schemes that defrauded over 15,400 victims out of an actual loss amount of nearly $90 million,” prosecutors wrote. Attorneys from the Federal Public Defender’s Office representing Garcia did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment on the sentence. — CNBC’s Dan Mangan contributed to this report.",CNBC,Center,619,"Center

142,Kash Patel’s Foundation Announces over $1M in Grants Awarded in Major Milestone,"The Kash Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit founded primarily by former Trump administration official and Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Nominee Kash Patel, announced Thursday it has surpassed $1 million in grants awarded. “Reaching the $1 million mark in grants is a reflection of Kash Patel’s steadfast dedication to serving Americans. This foundation was created to ensure individuals and families have the resources they need to stand up for what’s right. We are honored to be part of a movement that is making a real difference,” Erica Knight, spokesperson for The Kash Foundation, said in a statement to Breitbart News. She added, “This milestone represents the collective efforts of our donors, supporters, and team. It’s not just about the numbers—it’s about the lives changed and the voices amplified.” Knight said all of the funds raised have gone directly toward grant giving and have not provided any financial benefit to Patel whatsoever. She added that if Patel is confirmed as FBI director, he will resign from the board of the foundation. The Kash Foundation, established in 2022, provides direct financial grants, scholarships, and legal defense funds to support veterans, law enforcement, students, and whistleblowers who are seeking justice and transparency, and efforts to ensure government accountability. The foundation said the $1 million in grants has gone to: Support for Veterans and Law Enforcement: Offering financial assistance to veterans, active-duty service members, and law enforcement personnel; Educational Opportunities: Providing scholarships through programs like the Josh Cremeans Scholarship Fund to empower the next generation of leaders; Legal Defense for Whistleblowers: Providing financial assistance to those who provide credible information of waste, fraud ,and abuse, so we the people can hold government institutions accountable and support individuals speaking out against corruption; Providing disaster relief and helping to rebuild communities ravaged by mother nature and other misfortunes; and Public Awareness Campaigns: Promoting transparency and educating citizens on issues often improperly covered by the mainstream media. A whistleblower who received legal assistance said in a statement: “Without The Kash Foundation, I wouldn’t have had the means to stand up against government overreach. Their support has been life-changing.” The foundation has been funded by grassroots fundraising, digital campaigns, and merchandise sales, according to Knight. “As Americans, we know the importance of standing up for those in need and our American values,” she said. “The Kash Foundation has grown thanks to the passionate support of individuals who share our vision for a better America for all.” Knight said the foundation is committed to expanding its impact and in 2025 will increase scholarships and support to whistleblowers, veterans, and law enforcement. “We’re just getting started,” Knight said. “Our mission is clear, and we will continue to fight for Americans and the principles that make this nation great. Together, we can ensure that every voice is heard, protected and fostered for a more unified tomorrow.” Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on ”X”, Truth Social, or on Facebook.",Breitbart,Right,486,"Lean Right

342,"Trump allies draw ‘red line’ at Hegseth, warning defeat would kneecap chances for other key nominees","The embattled nomination of Pete Hegseth for defense secretary has President-elect Donald Trump and allies working to hold the line on a second pick getting nixed or risk opening the floodgates for rejection of his unconventional nominees, including Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Mr. Hegseth, a retired Army major, veterans’ advocate and former Fox News host, pledged Thursday that he was “not going to back down” as he made the rounds on Capitol Hill for another day of interviews with senators. Accusations of past misconduct could lead Republicans to sink his nomination. With his closest allies, the president-elect is focusing on getting Mr. Hegseth confirmed or at least forcing senators to vote on his nomination to stop what could become a cascade of rejections of Mr. Trump’s anti-establishment picks. “Pete Hegseth is our red line,” said Charlie Kirk, whose Turning Point Action and associated foundation helped elect Mr. Trump. “There are a lot of Republican senators in the election cycle in 2026, and they should think twice before standing opposed to President Trump’s picks.” Some Senate Republicans have registered skepticism about Mr. Kennedy’s nomination to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. Kennedy has questioned the safety of vaccines and fluoridated water and has personal issues that include sexual misconduct allegations. Mr. Trump’s pick of Ms. Gabbard, a former House member, to serve as director of national intelligence is also facing pushback. Some Senate Republicans question whether she has enough experience for the job. A surrender by Mr. Hegseth “would absolutely embolden the sort of recalcitrant senators to continue to oppose President Trump’s nominees,” said Will Chamberlain, senior counsel at the judicial advocacy group Article III Project. Senate Republicans, who will control the majority in January and could greenlight Mr. Trump’s picks without any Democratic votes, have forced out former Rep. Matt Gaetz. The firebrand abandoned his nomination to become Mr. Trump’s attorney general last month after several party lawmakers made clear they would not back him because of sexual misconduct allegations. Mr. Gaetz, who quit Congress last month amid an ethics inquiry, dropped out of the running after just a day of meetings with senators and without a single public hearing or a Senate floor vote. Mr. Trump and his allies don’t want a repeat with Mr. Hegseth, who is struggling to win over up to a half-dozen skeptical Republicans. “We need to make these senators vote because if they’re going to do this to a second nominee, that isn’t going to be fun for them,” Mr. Chamberlain said. “They’re going to feel the full pressure of the grassroots and that they’re going to have to stand up and put their vote on the record against President Trump’s defense secretary nominee.” Some polls show Americans approve of Mr. Trump’s Cabinet picks after his sweeping victory on Nov. 5. At least one survey found a majority of Americans saying sexual misconduct allegations, a history of substance abuse or financial misconduct is disqualifying. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa is among the Senate Republicans casting doubt on confirming Mr. Hegseth because of reports of past misconduct. He was accused of sexual assault, infidelity in his first two marriages, financial mismanagement of veterans organizations he ran and excessive drinking around co-workers. Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, is another Hegseth skeptic targeted by Trump allies. They say he opposes Mr. Hegseth because the nominee would attempt to overhaul the Pentagon. Mr. Graham said his scrutiny of Mr. Hegseth had nothing to do with blocking Trump nominees who are non-establishment picks. “It ain’t about slippery slopes,” Mr. Graham said. “It’s about those who fight and die for our country, that they are in good hands.” Mr. Hegseth barnstormed Republican senators’ offices Thursday to defend himself and again make the case that he is up to leading a department with an $850 billion budget and more than 2 million military personnel. Mr. Hegseth told reporters he has “done tough things in tough places.” He was referring to his deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq, where he served in combat. “And sometimes that changes you a little bit,” Mr. Hegseth said. “And by the grace of God and my Lord and Savior, I had an opportunity to come on up out of it and do great things with great veterans organizations that fought for vets and fought for reform at the [Department of Veterans Affairs] and for warfighters, and at the Fox News Channel to advocate for those various causes.” Mr. Hegseth met with Sen. Mike Rounds, South Dakota Republican, who said afterward that he saw a path for the nominee to win confirmation. Mr. Hegseth has pledged to some senators that he would not drink any alcohol if confirmed to the top Pentagon post. Mr. Rounds defended the Senate scrutiny that has rankled Trump allies. “We give the president the benefit of the doubt in building his team, but we also want to ask the questions that the public would ask and to be able to get those questions out so that the public has confidence that we’ve made the right choices as well,” Mr. Rounds said.",WashingtonTimes,Lean Right,855,"Lean Right

According to media reports this week, Hegseth's nomination is in jeopardy due to allegations about his personal and professional life. It even was reported that Trump had zeroed in on several potential candidates to replace the Army veteran and TV personality. Trump on Friday said he is sticking with Hegseth. ""Pete Hegseth is doing very well. His support is strong and deep, much more so than the Fake News would have you believe,"" Trump posted on Truth Social.

Pete is a WINNER, and there is nothing that can be done to change that!!!"" Also on Friday, The Guardian reported that Trump aides have told the president-elect's transition team that they haven't found three Republican senators who are ""categorically opposed"" to Hegseth's confirmation. Hegseth has been meeting with senators this week in efforts to secure confirmation votes amid allegations of sexual assault and a problematic drinking habit. At the Capitol on Wednesday, Hegseth said he spoke with Trump, who encouraged him to ""keep going, keep fighting."" Hegseth wrote a Wednesday opinion column for The Wall Street Journal to ostensibly set the record straight and to fight against a ""manufactured media takedown.""

161,Supreme Court hears challenge to law banning gender-affirming care for trans kids,"Front and center at the Supreme Court on Wednesday is the battle over the rights of transgender children. At issue is a state law in Tennessee that blocks minors from accessing gender-affirming care in the state. In the last three years, more than two dozen states have enacted laws that ban puberty blockers, hormones and other treatments for minors seeking gender-affirming care. The issue has become highly politicized, as anyone who watched election ads this fall can attest. Challenging Tennessee's law in the Supreme Court are three trans kids and their parents. LW, as she is known in legal documents, is one of them. ""People make assumptions. They say it's just a phase, because they don't know what it's like,"" LW says of her experience. ""It can certainly feel pretty hopeless,"" especially given ""how slow"" the process is. Her mother, Samantha Williams, partially disagrees, stressing the need for caution. ""We kept saying we wouldn't be good parents if we weren't taking our time,"" she says. It took nearly a year for LW to get the go ahead, but LW's mom says that at 15, her once troubled child is an easy and happy teenager, now that she is getting access to treatments for gender dysphoria. The medications, however, are now illegal for minors in Tennessee where the family lives, so they have to drive out of state 10 hours round trip for LW to get the drugs for her transition. Tennessee state Sen. Jack Johnson introduced the challenged bill, which bans access to hormones, puberty blockers and other treatments for trans kids in Tennessee. For Johnson, the law is just another example of the state exercising its regulatory power. ""You can't get a tattoo in Tennessee unless you're 18. You can't smoke. You can't drink,"" he observes. Tennessee regulates ""a number of different types of medical procedures,"" Johnson says, adding that ""it felt like this was the best public policy to prevent kids form suffering from irreversible consequences, things that cannot be undone."" Those challenging the Tennessee law counter that the ban violates the Constitution's guarantee to equal protection of the law. The law bars access to treatment for kids who want to transition from their sex assigned at birth, but permits those same medications to be used when treating minors suffering from other conditions, like endometriosis or early-onset puberty. ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio, the first openly trans lawyer to argue in front of the Supreme Court, represents the kids and their parents. He argues that ""these are very commonly used medications,"" and Tennessee ""bans them for one and only one purpose."" Strangio says that the language of the statute telegraphs the real purpose of the ban. Specifically, the statute encourages minors to ""appreciate their sex"" and bans treatments that ""might encourage minors to be disdainful of their sex."" ""The government of Tennessee is displacing the decision-making of loving parents,"" who follow the ""recommendations of doctors,"" Strangio says. ""At the end of the day, the law is tailored to one and only one interest, which is to enforce Tennessee's preference that adolescents conform to their birth sex."" Although the Tennessee legislature did hear testimony from individual doctors in support of the ban, all the major medical associations that deal with gender dysphoria have filed briefs supporting these treatments for trans kids, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association. But critics of the treatments say the science is very unsettled in terms of long-term implications. ""You've got countries in Western Europe that were far ahead of us in terms of these types of medications,"" says Sen. Johnson. ""They are pulling back because they've had a longer runway, and they're seeing that the adverse effects of some of these medications far outweigh any benefit that they have."" John Bursch of the conservative Christian legal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom echoes that sentiment, noting that some Western European and Scandinavian countries have not only been at this longer, they have national health care systems that cover everyone. ""They can track a patient from birth until death. And so if someone gets cross-sex hormones for the purpose of a gender change at age 15, they can look at how they're doing at age 20, 25, 45, 65 and see what the outcomes were,"" Bursch notes. These characterizations of European studies are highly controversial, but the drugs are still accessible in a research setting, and access has not been terminated for any minor already using the medications. There is much about this issue that remains in dispute. To take just one example, parents Samantha and Brian Williams maintain that the law not only bans treatments, it bars parents and children from even consulting doctors about these treatments. The law's supporters deny that claim to varying degrees. Sen. Johnson says that the ""legislative intent does not prohibit or prevent any type of conversation."" Bursch, on the other hand, says that a family could generally have a conversation about the pros and cons of puberty blockers and hormone treatment, ""as long as the doctor was not encouraging someone to engage in an illegal procedure."" NPR put the question to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which until the law was passed was the major center in Tennessee for providing gender-affirming care for minors. The center took three days to ponder the question, ultimately declining to comment. Vanderbilt does still provide gender-affirming care for adult patients. But lawyers for the trans kids argue that if states can ban gender dysphoria treatments for minors, the next step will be to ban such treatments for adults, too. Sen. Johnson, the sponsor of the Tennessee bill, sees things very differently. ""We want to love these kids,"" he says. ""But let's see if we can get them to their 18th birthday, which is when we recognize people as an adult."" The court is expected to make a decision in the case by the summer.",NPR,Lean Left,988,"Left  
The article addresses a contentious legal issue surrounding transgender rights and gender-affirming care for minors, framing it in the context of civil rights and personal freedom. Voices advocating for transgender children and critiques of the Tennessee law are prominent, suggesting a perspective that favors transgender rights.

104,"‘A Press Release Is Not A Pardon’: Judge Shreds Biden’s Hunter Move, Calls President A Liar","Trump-appointed Judge Mark C. Scarsi ripped into President Joe Biden’s decision to pardon his son Hunter Biden on Tuesday in a filing, saying that while the president has broad authority, he cannot “rewrite history.” Biden released a statement Sunday evening announcing his pardon of Hunter Biden’s cases, claiming that any “reasonable” person reviewing the facts in the case would conclude that his son was being targeted because of his connection to the president. In a filing on Tuesday evening, Scarsi, who presided over Hunter’s federal tax case in California, criticized the president for misrepresenting the facts in his statement. (RELATED: Fmr Obama Aide Slams Biden As ‘A Tragic Figure,’ Says His Ego Keeps Getting ‘In The Way’) “According to the President, ‘[n]o reasonable person who looks at the facts of [Mr. Biden’s] cases can reach any other conclusion than [Mr. Biden] was singled out only because he is [the President’s] son.’ But two federal judges expressly rejected Mr. Biden’s arguments that the Government prosecuted Mr. Biden because of his familial relation to the President,” Scarsi wrote.

In the President’s estimation, this legion of federal civil servants, the undersigned included, are unreasonable people,” Scarsi said. “In short, a press release is not a pardon. The Constitution provides the President with broad authority to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 1, but nowhere does the Constitution give the President the authority to rewrite history.” In September, Hunter pleaded guilty to federal tax charges in his California case after he allegedly failed to pay an estimated $1.4 million in taxes and filed falsified tax paperwork. While Scarsi had initially accepted the plea and scheduled Hunter’s sentencing for Dec. 16, he stated in his recent ruling that he would vacate the sentencing hearing but would not terminate the case until the pardon is formally signed by Biden. Since Biden’s announcement to pardon his son, the president has faced major backlash from pundits and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle due to his and his staff’s repeated denials that he would pardon Hunter.

219,"After years of legal fights, North Carolina's voter ID law gets its first major test","CHARLOTTE, N.C. — For more than a decade, North Carolina has been home to a bitter back-and-forth over whether voters must show identification to cast a ballot in the swing state. The requirement finally got its first major test in last month's presidential election. Overall, just a tiny fraction of people had their ballots rejected. But critics say voter ID is still a solution in search of a problem, and they note that Black voters were more likely to have their ballots rejected than white voters. Kelle Pressley of Charlotte was one of the voters nearly affected. Pressley is a consistent voter, having cast a ballot 29 times since 2008, counting primaries and general elections. But when she came to vote on Election Day last month, she realized she didn't have her ID. ""I change bags often, and I was thinking I had it on me, but I didn't,"" she said. ""I still haven't found it."" Pressley said there was confusion at her precinct about her options. She said poll workers urged her to go home and find her ID, instead of having her cast a provisional ballot and fill out an ID exception form, which allows voters to list a reason why they don't have an ID. The reasons range from a voter lacking transportation to them losing their ID. Pressley went home and called a voter protection hotline. She then came back to her precinct an hour before polls closed. She said this time poll workers allowed her to fill out the exception form and cast a provisional ballot. Her vote ultimately counted. ""Someone else would have … been like, 'Forget about it, I'm not voting,' "" she said. ""'Que sera sera, whatever will be will be.' "" Pressley was one of nearly 6,900 North Carolinians who came to vote without photo ID. Out of more than 5.7 million voters, that's about one in every 830 voters who cast ballots. Most of those people were able to cast a provisional ballot. County elections boards counted most of them and, in the end, just 1,670 people had their ballots rejected because they didn't have ID. The rejection rate was one in every 3,400 voters. But attorney Kathleen Roblez with the group Forward Justice, which has a pending lawsuit over the voter ID law, said that's still too many people, considering in-person voter fraud has been found to be almost nonexistent. And she said more people were probably impacted this year than show up in state data. ""So you really have no idea how many people saw all of the information about ID and said, 'I can't vote,' "" Roblez said. Voter ID is required in 36 states, including the swing states of Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin. North Carolina's fight over ID rules has lasted more than a decade. Two years after Republicans gained control of the state legislature in 2011, GOP lawmakers passed a strict photo ID law. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 overturned the law, ruling that Republican legislators targeted Black voters with ""almost surgical precision."" In 2018, lawmakers tried again. They placed a constitutional amendment on the ballot requiring photo ID. It was approved with 55% of the vote. It also had support from some Black lawmakers. The legislature then passed a law to implement the amendment. The second photo ID law was more lenient than the 2013 version, allowing voters to use multiple IDs and to get a free ID from their county elections board. It also allowed people to cast provisional ballots so long as they list a reason for not having identification. Six voters sued over the new law, along with the NAACP. In 2021, North Carolina judges struck down the law, saying it again discriminated against Black voters. Allison Riggs, who is now on the state Supreme Court, was an attorney for the plaintiffs. She said that ruling shows ""how the state's Republican-controlled legislature undeniably implemented this legislation to maintain its power by targeting voters of color."" But in 2023, the state Supreme Court — with a new Republican majority — said that photo ID could proceed. The requirement was in place for municipal elections that fall, and in the March 2024 primary. The November general election was photo ID's first major test. A small fraction of people had ballots rejected. But there was a racial disparity. Black voters had 30% of the rejected ballots, despite being about 20% of the electorate. ""Black North Carolinians statistically lack the kind of IDs that would be approved,"" Roblez said. ""And they are also statistically more likely to have a hard time getting the other ID."" Andy Jackson, with the conservative John Locke Foundation, said it's important to note that the number of rejected ballots for each racial group was small. For Black voters, 502 people had their ballots rejected, compared with 622 white voters. He said there will always be disparities among groups in any requirement. ""I don't know if anyone ever expects any statistic to be exactly the same,"" he said. Some North Carolina Republicans have questioned whether the state's voter ID exception form undermines the purpose of the law. But Jackson said he believes most Republicans want to move on. ""I don't know how strict they want to go because I don't know if they have an appetite for another lawsuit,"" he said. On Monday, GOP lawmakers advanced a new measure that would codify in the state constitution that photo ID is needed for voting by mail as well. Photo ID wouldn't have materially affected the state's presidential race this year, which Donald Trump won by 183,000 votes. But some contests were much closer, like a state Supreme Court race, where Riggs, a Democrat, went into a recount against her Republican opponent up by just 722 votes.",NPR,Lean Left,967,"Lean Left  
The article leans left in its presentation, emphasizing concerns about racial disparities and the potential disenfranchisement of Black voters due to North Carolina's voter ID law. It features quotes from critics of the law, particularly highlighting the negative impact on marginalized groups, while including a brief counterpoint from a conservative source. The focus on social justice and voter protection reflects a progressive perspective, particularly in the context of the ongoing legal conflicts surrounding voting rights. Overall, the tone suggests a skepticism toward voter ID laws that is aligned with left-leaning viewpoints."
331,"Jill Biden, U.S. first lady, in the capital of the United Arab Emirates on last solo foreign trip","ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — Jill Biden used a tour of the United Arab Emirates’ capital Thursday to praise efforts to fight cancer and call for more attention on women’s health issues as part of her final solo foreign tour as first lady. Biden, 73, arrived in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday night after visiting Italy and seeing her ancestral home of Gesso in Sicily. On Thursday, she began a tour of the capital in the afternoon, stopping first to visit Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak Al Ketbi at the massive compound for Qasr Al Bahra. Sheikha Fatima, known as the “mother of the nation,” is a wife of the UAE’s late first ruler Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and the mother of its current ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The visit, while not focused on political issues, shows the importance the United States holds for the UAE, an autocratically ruled federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. The Emirates hosts thousands of American troops. The country’s Jebel Ali port in Dubai also is the U.S. Navy’s busiest port of call outside of the U.S. The UAE also is a major buyer of Boeing Co. aircraft for its long-haul airlines Emirates and Etihad, and has been focused on winning American support for its push into artificial intelligence. Biden then stopped at the Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, where she and her daughter, Ashley Biden, met with doctors at the hospital to learn about the clinic’s efforts to battle cancer. She recounted the shock of losing Beau Biden, a son of President Joe Biden and his late first wife, to brain cancer. “It was the same for us. We were just like everyone else,” she recounted. “We walked in. We heard: ‘Brain cancer.’ We heard nothing else.” Afterward, Biden visited Qasr Al Hosn, a historic fort in the center of Abu Dhabi’s gleaming skyscrapers. She paused to look at kerosene lamps lining one wall and signed a guestbook. “May the wisdom of these walls continue to light a way forward in peace and prosperity for centuries to come,” Biden wrote. Biden has come to the country previously. In March 2016, she accompanied her husband, then the vice president in the last year of the Obama administration, on a trip to the Emirates. But this trip comes after President Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden over federal crimes after previously pledging that he wouldn’t. The president dodged questions about the pardon while he was on a trip to Angola. For her part, Jill Biden on Monday said: “Of course I support the pardon of my son.” Biden found herself welcomed without any political questions, only acknowledging in passing at the Milken Institute’s Middle East and Africa Summit Thursday afternoon that she and her husband will soon “leave office together.” “Women deserve answers about their health, because this is really an economic issue I think for women, and globally really, the research and the funding and the products,” Biden told the summit, noting that medical research for too long had focused primarily on men. Biden will travel next to nearby Qatar. After that she’ll fly to Paris and join President-elect Donald Trump and other dignitaries in Paris to celebrate the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral. She’ll then return to Washington.",WashingtonTimes,Lean Right,549,"Center

135,Rep. Laurel Lee to Newsmax: Biden Pardon Doesn't Cover Civil,"Rep. Laurel Lee, R-Fla., told Newsmax on Thursday that the ""striking"" pardon that Hunter Biden received from his father doesn't cover civil disputes, but it also means he can no longer plead the fifth in criminal cases. Lee joined ""The Record With Greta Van Susteren"" to react to the allegation that Hunter Biden owes $300,000 in back rent from a Venice, California, property rented between 2019-20. President Joe Biden issued a sweeping pardon to his son for everything he did or might have done over a 11-year period, including wiping out a federal conviction for guns and the younger Biden's plea of guilty to federal tax evasion. ""So the significance of the pardon is that it basically means he can't be prosecuted for federal crimes during this expansive period of time. And that's what's really the most striking about the pardon itself, is that it covers all of his behavior for this vast period of time,"" Lee said. ""But what a pardon cannot cover are civil cases like the one you mentioned about rent. He would still be responsible for any sort of breach of contract or potential civil damages that may be appropriate."" Lee was also asked if House Republicans might subpoena Hunter Biden to testify again, now that he doesn't enjoy Fifth Amendment protections to self-incrimination. ""And the other significant implication is that he no longer can claim the Fifth Amendment privilege as it relates to federal crimes, because the privilege exists only to protect people from incriminating themselves in criminal investigations. Since he can no longer be prosecuted, he no longer is in peril of being prosecuted for these federal crimes,"" Lee said.

The article, published by Newsmax, presents a perspective aligning with conservative views, particularly regarding Hunter Biden and the implications of his pardon from President Biden. It focuses on Rep. Laurel Lee's critical commentary about the pardon, illustrating a skeptical stance towards the Biden administration. The use of a Republican representative as the primary source, alongside a generally critical tone regarding the Biden family, indicates a leaning right bias in the reporting."
224,"Who was Brian Thompson, the UnitedHealthcare CEO shot dead in Manhattan?","Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was shot to death Wednesday outside the New York Hilton Midtown in Manhattan, where the company was hosting an investor day. Thompson, 50, was named CEO of UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group's insurance arm, in April 2021. He first joined UnitedHealth Group in 2004 and had previously served as CEO of the company's government programs, including Medicare and retiree coverage, and community and state programs providing Medicaid and other types of coverage to millions of individuals. In his most recent role as CEO of UnitedHealthcare, he was responsible for leading growth across the company's global, employer, individual, specialty and government benefits businesses, according to a 2021 company statement announcing his appointment. ""Brian's experience, relationships and values make him especially well-suited to help UnitedHealthcare improve how health care works for consumers, physicians, employers, governments and our other partners, leading to continued and sustained long-term growth,"" UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said at the time. Thompson held other positions over his 20 years at the company, including chief financial officer for UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual, Community and State and Medicare and Retirement businesses. He also served as the financial controller for UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual business and was a director in the company's corporate development division. For a top executive at a $562 billion company that affects how millions of Americans get health care, Thompson kept a relatively low profile. At an investor meeting last year, he outlined UnitedHealth's shift to ""value-based care,"" paying doctors and other caregivers to keep patients healthy, rather than focusing on treating them when they get sick. ""Health care should be easier for people,"" Thompson said at the time. ""We are cognizant of the challenges. But navigating a future through value-based care unlocks a situation where the … family doesn't have to make the decisions on their own."" In 2023, Thompson earned total compensation of $10.2 million, according to a disclosure by UnitedHealth Group. Before joining UnitedHealth Group, Thompson worked as a certified public accountant at accounting firm PwC, according to his biography on networking site LinkedIn. Thompson graduated from the University of Iowa in 1997 with a bachelor's degree in business administration and most recently resided in Maple Grove, Minnesota. Following the shooting, UnitedHealthcare canceled its Wednesday meeting with Wall Street analysts and investors, which Thompson had been scheduled to attend. ""We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare,"" UnitedHealth Group said in a statement. ""Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him. We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian's family and all who were close to him."" On LinkedIn, former colleagues described Thompson as an ""affable"" and ""popular"" leader. ""BT was whip-smart and affable — a guy who could grasp the complexities of health care and explain them in simple, relatable terms true to his Iowa upbringing,"" said Matt Burns, who served as vice president of communications at UnitedHealth Group from 2015 to 2018. Thompson is survived by his wife, Paulette Thompson, and two sons. ""We are shattered to hear about the senseless killing of our beloved Brian,"" Thompson's wife said in a statement provided to CBS News by her sister. ""Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives. Most importantly, Brian was an incredibly loving father to our two sons and will be greatly missed. We appreciate your well wishes and request complete privacy as our family moves through this difficult time."" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also weighed in on Thompson's death. ""This is a shocking and devastating loss for our whole community. 'Shocking' is the only word I can find at the moment,"" he said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. He added in a post on social media that Thompson was ""a great man."" Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar expressed her condolences for Thompson's family and for United Healthcare employees in the state, calling the shooting ""a horrifying and shocking act of violence"" in a post on X. In his own post, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called Thompson's death ""a terrible loss for the business and health care community in Minnesota.""
