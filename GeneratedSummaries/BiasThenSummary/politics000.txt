**Classification:** The article fits into the "right" category. 

**Explanation:** The article discusses the Conservative Party's (Tory) immigration and asylum proposals, which focus on stricter controls, quotas, and overseas processing of claims. These align with right-leaning political ideologies that emphasize national security, control over immigration, and skepticism towards multicultural policies. Moreover, Michael Howard, representing the Tory stance, actively defends the party's plans against accusations of racism, suggesting a defensive posture commonly seen in right-leaning narratives. The criticism from left-oriented parties like Labour and the Liberal Democrats further solidifies this classification, contrasting the Tories' approach with typically leftist views advocating for more humanitarian immigration policies.

**Summary:** 

Michael Howard, leader of the Conservative Party, presented their proposals to reform the UK's asylum system, asserting they are not racist and aim to support genuine refugees. The Tory plans include an annual limit on asylum seekers, processing claims overseas, and cutting ties with international obligations that protect refugees based on need. Howard emphasized the need for stringent immigration controls, citing personal experience as a child of immigrants. Critics, including Labour leader Tony Blair, claim the plans would worsen immigration issues by reducing frontline staff. Liberal Democrats expressed concern that the proposals might endanger genuine asylum seekers. The plans include detaining undocumented asylum seekers and introducing quotas for work permits, drawing criticism for potentially contravening EU asylum policies. Refugee organizations labeled the proposals as dangerous and irresponsible, warning that they might put lives at risk. Howard maintained that the intentions behind these measures focus on dismantling people smuggling networks and ensuring fair treatment within the immigration system.
