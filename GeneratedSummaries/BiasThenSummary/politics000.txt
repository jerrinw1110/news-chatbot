**Classification**: Left

**Explanation**: The article discusses proposals from the UK Labour Party to increase maternity pay, which aligns with left-leaning ideologies that favor social welfare programs and increasing support for families. The language is supportive of government intervention to enhance benefits for new mothers, positioning the Labour Party as taking initiative for workers' rights. The criticisms from the Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats reflect a struggle between left-oriented policies and more conservative viewpoints, but the overall tone of the article highlights an agenda consistent with left or liberal viewpoints.

**Summary**: Labour's Trade and Industry Secretary, Patricia Hewitt, announced plans to increase maternity pay by Â£1,400, extending paid leave for new mothers to nine months by 2007, with aspirations for a full year by the next Parliament. Current maternity leave is 12 months, but only the first six months are paid, prompting the need for reform. Hewitt emphasized that the proposed moneys would be taxpayer-funded, not coming from employers. The Conservative Party called the proposal "desperate," while the Liberal Democrats critiqued it for misdirection. Theresa May, Shadow Secretary for the Family, indicated that the announcement was merely a rehash of previous proposals. Meanwhile, concerns were raised by the British Chambers of Commerce regarding the potential burden on small businesses. Further details on the maternity plans are expected soon.
