The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on whether to allow Westminster to legislate on super-casinos, with potential plans for up to eight resorts in the UK, including one in Glasgow. While Scottish ministers claim they retain final decision-making power, opposition parties argue otherwise. The legislation also aims to regulate internet gambling and protect children. The vote is anticipated to be close, reflecting tensions between the Scottish Executive and opposition parties over responsibility.
