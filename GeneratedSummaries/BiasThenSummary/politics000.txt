The article can be classified as "right." 

This classification is based on the content and tone of the article which discusses the Conservative Party's (Tory) proposals for immigration reform, particularly focusing on stricter asylum and immigration controls. The proposals, as outlined by Michael Howard, advocate for policies like reducing the number of asylum seekers and processing claims outside the UK, which are typically associated with right-wing political ideologies that emphasize strict immigration enforcement and national security. 

Moreover, the defense against accusations of racism and claims that immigration controls are necessary for community relations further indicate a right-leaning perspective that often seeks to balance immigration management with a sense of national identity and security. 

The criticisms from opposition parties and organizations like the Refugee Council highlight concerns associated with these right-wing policies, but the primary focus of the article is on the Conservative Party's affirmative statements about their plans, aligning this piece with a right-leaning bias.
