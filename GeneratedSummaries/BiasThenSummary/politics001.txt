**Summary:**

The Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas, is investigating Cabinet Office orders instructing staff to delete e-mails older than three months, which he condemned as a potential means to evade the Freedom of Information Act (FOI) coming into effect on January 1. Thomas stated that destroying records to avoid disclosure could become a criminal offense, emphasizing a pre-existing civil service guideline to retain e-mails in doubt. The timing of these deletion orders has sparked scrutiny, with Tory leader Michael Howard and Lib Dems questioning their intent. While the Cabinet Office denied any connection to the FOI laws, concerns linger over the potential harm to key investigations, such as the Hutton Inquiry, resulting from the loss of millions of e-mails.
