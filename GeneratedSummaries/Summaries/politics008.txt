Alastair Campbell, former media chief for No. 10, has sparked a political controversy after mistakenly sending an e-mail containing an expletive directed at BBC journalists. The message, intended for a party official, criticized the BBC's questioning of his involvement in Labour's controversial poster campaign. Campbell labeled the incident a "silly fuss" after trying to clarify the mix-up with Newsnight. This e-mail came on the heels of warnings from Peter Mandelson, a former Labour minister, advising the BBC against "demonizing" Campbell.

The row stems from Labour's posters—one depicting flying pigs and another controversially likening Tory leader Michael Howard to Fagin—leading to accusations of anti-Semitism, which Labour denies. Campbell's original e-mail suggested TBWA, the advertising agency, should publicly defend the promotional materials. Following the incident, Campbell reached out to Newsnight to acknowledge his error and reiterated that he had a good working relationship with TBWA.

Prime Minister's spokesman asserted that Campbell is capable of addressing his own comments, as he is no longer in government. While Foreign Secretary Jack Straw referred to Campbell as “talented” and noted his cordial interactions, Liam Fox, Conservative co-chairman, criticized Campbell's return as indicative of Labour's "sinister and underhand tactics."
