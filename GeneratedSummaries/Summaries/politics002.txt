Chancellor Gordon Brown emphasized that Britain's economic future will be central to Labour's election campaign, asserting that Labour has ensured stability and growth. This statement followed the final Cabinet meeting before an anticipated election announcement. The Tories are focusing on "yob culture," while the Lib Dems detailed proposals to replace council tax. Meanwhile, the Archbishop of Canterbury urged all parties to avoid exploiting public fears, suggesting they focus on issues like the environment and criminal justice reform. Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram defended the Tory campaign, while Labour's Jack Straw criticized Tory leader Michael Howard for lacking wisdom and strategy. The discussion comes as the Institute of Fiscal Studies reported a drop in household incomes for the first time in over a decade, which the Treasury dismissed. Alan Milburn, a top Labour official, claimed average incomes have risen significantly since 1997, attributing recent declines to the global economic downturn affecting self-employed individuals.
