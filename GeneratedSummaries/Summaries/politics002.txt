Labour's Trade and Industry Secretary, Patricia Hewitt, emphasized the need to extend paid maternity leave beyond the current six months, calling it a crucial addition to the party's election manifesto. Speaking at a seminar hosted by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC), she noted that the financial implications of this proposal were being evaluated. Currently, mothers receive six months of paid and six months of unpaid leave, but Hewitt aims to address the need for extending the payment period.

Additionally, Hewitt highlighted ongoing issues of sexism in the workplace, which she believes hampers women's career advancement and contributes to the gender pay gap, where women earn 19% less than men. Proposed initiatives include funding for universities to assist female graduates in science and engineering and providing "taster courses" in non-traditional occupations for both genders.

Hewitt argued that combating "career sexism" is essential for closing the pay gap, as many jobs in certain sectors remain gender-segregated. She pointed out that women dominate low-paid positions, while engineering and construction industries are heavily male-dominated. The Department for Trade and Industry is also set to fund a TUC panel aimed at advising companies on establishing equal wages, addressing significant disparities in pay and top job representation for women.
