The article presents the immigration and asylum reform plans of the Conservative Party (Tories) with a focus on stricter immigration controls, processing asylum claims overseas, and implementing annual quotas. Michael Howard's statements position these strategies as necessary for enhancing fairness and combating illegal immigration. The language used adopts a defensive stance against accusations of racism, thereby framing the plans as rational and corrective rather than discriminatory. Additionally, criticism from Labour and other parties is included, but it does not overshadow the central narrative of the Conservative policy proposals. The emphasis on reducing immigration and managing asylum processes reflects a right-leaning perspective. 

**Summary:**

Michael Howard, leader of the Conservative Party, unveiled plans to reform the UK's asylum system, arguing that these measures are not racist but essential for a fair processing framework for genuine refugees. Key proposals include overseas processing of asylum claims, annual limits on asylum seekers, and automatic removal of those from safe countries. Howard asserted that controlling immigration is vital for community relations and that the current system is "unfair and inhumane," with only 20% of claims accepted.

The plans face significant opposition, with Labour leader Tony Blair criticizing the potential increase in immigration problems resulting from cuts to border staff. Charities and organizations, including the UN refugee agency, expressed serious concerns that these reforms could endanger the lives of genuine refugees. The Liberal Democrats called the proposals "absolutely disgusting," emphasizing the need for a fair asylum process.

Howard acknowledged that his own immigrant background informs his beliefs on immigration but stressed the importance of distinguishing between asylum seekers and economic migrants. The article highlights worries that the reforms may not align with EU asylum policies and could send negative signals to countries hosting most refugees. Overall, Howard's stance reflects a strong push for tougher immigration controls while addressing criticisms.
