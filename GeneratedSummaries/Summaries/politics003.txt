The Labour Party has decided to hold its 2006 autumn conference in Manchester, breaking with the tradition of seaside venues like Blackpool. This marks the first time since 1917 that Manchester will host the event. Blackpool will instead host a smaller spring conference in February, which is seen as a compromise. Traditionally, political parties rotate meetings among Blackpool, Bournemouth, and Brighton, making this decision a setback for Blackpool's economy. Colin Asplin from the Blackpool Hotel Association expressed disappointment, emphasizing the town's working-class identity. The financial impact on Blackpool remains uncertain as attendees are expected to book in Manchester.
