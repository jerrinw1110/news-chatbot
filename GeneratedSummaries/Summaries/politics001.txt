The information commissioner, Richard Thomas, is investigating orders from the Cabinet Office instructing staff to delete emails older than three months, asserting these actions could jeopardize transparency under the forthcoming Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) effective January 1. Thomas condemned such deletions, emphasizing the law mustn't be misused to hide information. Both the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties have raised concerns over the timing of these regulations, suggesting it might coincide with the implementation of the FOIA to evade scrutiny. Tory leader Michael Howard called for an explanation from Prime Minister Tony Blair, while Liberal Democrat chairman Alan Beith highlighted potential negative impacts on significant investigations, such as the Hutton Inquiry. The Cabinet Office, however, insisted that the deleted emails were not critical records and claimed the policy was unrelated to the new laws. Thomas reiterated existing guidelines advocate retaining emails unless they have no current purpose and warned that destroying records to evade disclosure constitutes a criminal offense under the new legislation.
