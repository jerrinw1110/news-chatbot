A new study by researchers at Birkbeck College highlights alarming levels of sexist abuse endured by female MPs in the House of Commons. During interviews, 83 MPs shared experiences of sexist taunts from their male colleagues, including mockery involving imaginary breasts and derogatory remarks during speeches. Labour's Yvette Cooper recounted difficulties convincing Commons officials of her ministerial status, while other MPs shared similar experiences of disrespect and patronization. Barbara Follet reported male MPs imitating gestures and using the word “melons” as women spoke. Former Liberal Democrat MP Jackie Ballard described inappropriate comments about women's appearances, and Gillian Shepherd recalled a male colleague referring to all women as “Betty.” Harriet Harman faced hostility tied to her Cabinet advancement, with remarks suggesting her success was due to gender. Despite an increase in female representation since the 1997 general election, many women still feel marginalized in a predominantly male environment. Sarah Teather likened the culture to that of a teenage public school. Professor Joni Lovenduski, leading the research, expressed her shock at the extent of the findings, indicating that the presence of more women has helped address some issues, but significant challenges remain. She noted that the persistence of such attitudes in Parliament is concerning for the public. The interviews will be archived in the British Library.
