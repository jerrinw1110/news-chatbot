Prime Minister Tony Blair participated in a sailing trip with school children in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, as part of a campaign to promote his party's education policies ahead of the anticipated May 5 General Election. During his outing on a Wayfarer dinghy with students from St Egwin's Middle School and Education Secretary Ruth Kelly, he emphasized Labour's election pledges focused on education. These include enhancing parental choice among schools, granting secondary schools specialist status, establishing 200 city academies, and creating 100,000 additional sixth-form places. Blair also proposed a "zero tolerance" approach to classroom disruption and plans to better manage funding for disruptive pupils.

Acknowledging teachers' concerns about potential legal repercussions for outdoor activities, Blair reassured them that simple guidelines would mitigate risks. He asserted the importance of outdoor learning for children's development and health. In response to Blair's initiatives, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats criticized his promises, labeling them as ineffective. The Conservatives' shadow education secretary Tim Collins remarked that Blair's track record over two terms speaks for itself, while the Liberal Democrats advocate for smaller class sizes and ensuring qualified teachers in every subject. Blair's engagement with parents and teachers is part of a broader strategy to demonstrate connection with voters.
