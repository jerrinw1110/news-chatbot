Michael Howard, leader of the Conservative Party, has unveiled plans aimed at reforming the UK’s asylum system, asserting that these measures are not racist and will help protect genuine refugees. Key proposals include processing all asylum claims overseas, introducing an annual limit on asylum seekers, and prioritizing the removal of asylum seekers from safe countries or those with destroyed documents. The Tories also plan to detain undocumented asylum seekers for national security reasons.

Howard emphasized the need for "firm but fair" immigration controls and criticized the notion that such measures are racist, noting his own immigrant background. He argued that the reforms would disrupt human trafficking networks and reduce the number of people immigrating to the UK, as nearly 160,000 settle annually, equating to the size of a city.

Despite the proposals, opposition leaders, including Tony Blair of Labour and Matthew Taylor of the Liberal Democrats, criticized the plans, stating they could jeopardize refugees' lives if they are turned away once quotas are met. Concerns were raised regarding potential violations of international asylum obligations and the message sent to poorer countries bearing the refugee burden. The UN refugee agency and other advocacy groups have condemned the proposals as "dangerous" and "irresponsible." Howard dismissed the idea that his policy is racially motivated, calling such implications "disgraceful."

Overall, the Conservative party seeks to overhaul the UK’s asylum process, citing fairness and security as core objectives, while facing backlash from various factions concerned about human rights and ethical implications.
