Labour is proposing a £1,400 increase in maternity pay for new mothers, aiming to extend paid maternity leave to nine months by 2007, as announced by Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt. This change would follow a previous increase from 13 weeks to 26 weeks of paid leave, with a longer-term goal of extending it to a full year by the end of the next Parliament. The plans include potential options for fathers to share maternity leave and enhanced rights for parents of older children. 

While Labour emphasizes these changes, opposition parties reacted critically, with Conservatives labeling the proposal as “desperate” and the Liberal Democrats suggesting it misdirects funds. Hewitt reassured that costs would be covered by taxpayers, not employers, despite warnings from business leaders about the potential burdens on small firms. Currently, new mothers receive 90% of their average earnings for the first six weeks and £102.80 weekly until the baby reaches six months. More details on the government's plans are expected to be revealed soon.
