Tory co-chairman Liam Fox accused Prime Minister Tony Blair of lying about the reasons for the UK’s involvement in the Iraq War, suggesting that such dishonesty extends to the current election campaign. This criticism followed Blair’s assertion that the Conservatives promote a "hard right agenda." In a recent speech at Labour’s spring conference, Blair emphasized his continued passion for leadership and framed the upcoming election as crucial for the nation's future, claiming that choosing the Tories or Lib Dems would lead to regression rather than progress for Britain.

Fox suggested Labour would employ tactics of "fear and smear" against their opponents, labeling the party’s new pledges as "vacuous." He also refused to comment on reports that the Tories had repaid £500,000 to Lord Ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy launched a campaign to counter Blair's message and highlighted the growing significance of three-party politics in various regions. Kennedy argued that Blair's rhetoric of connection with delegates would not effectively restore public trust as he prepares for a nationwide tour, demonstrating the sharpening competition leading into the imminent election.
