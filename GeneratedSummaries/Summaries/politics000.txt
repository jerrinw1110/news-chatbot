The UK Labour Party is proposing to increase maternity pay for new mothers by £1,400, extending paid leave from six months to nine months by 2007, as announced by Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt. The aim is to eventually reach 12 months of paid maternity leave. Hewitt stated that current maternity leave is often not fully utilized due to pay limitations, as only six months are currently paid. The proposals also include options for fathers to take some maternity leave or pay, and plans to extend flexible working rights to parents of older children. The Conservative Party criticized the proposal, calling it a "desperate" move to gain women voters, while the Liberal Democrats deemed the funding misdirected. They suggested that any increase should focus on enhancing pay during the first six months of leave instead. Hewitt clarified that taxpayer funding would support these changes, not employers, but the British Chambers of Commerce warned that small businesses could struggle with the associated costs of recruitment and training. Further details of the proposals will be released soon, with current maternity pay at 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks and £102.80 until six months postpartum.
