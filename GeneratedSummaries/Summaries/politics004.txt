Chancellor Gordon Brown's ally, Ed Balls, has dismissed speculation of a pre-election Budget giveaway on March 16, emphasizing that there will be no spending spree ahead of the election. Balls, a former chief economic adviser now campaigning for Labour, expressed confidence that Mr. Brown would adhere to his fiscal rules and suggested the Chancellor would meet his economic targets with some margin. This assurance comes amid warnings from Sir Digby Jones, the CBI director general, not to use any extra funds for electioneering, highlighting the importance of maintaining economic stability.

While discussing the potential impact of rising interest rates, anticipated due to ongoing increases in house prices and consumer borrowing, Balls indicated that the Labour Party's election prospects would not be adversely affected by such a rise. He reiterated that the stability of the economy would not be compromised by the upcoming Budget.

Sir Digby Jones also stressed the need for prudent management of funds, urging that any excess be directed towards enhancing workforce skills instead of public spending. He praised Brown's history of prudence as Chancellor, advocating for stability in British business.

Amidst speculation regarding Brown's future role after the election, with hints that he might become Foreign Secretary, Balls reaffirmed Brown's commitment to a successful Labour government. The election date remains unconfirmed, but most observers expect it to be on May 5.
