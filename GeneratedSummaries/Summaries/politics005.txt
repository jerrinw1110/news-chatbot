The initial sale of the Millennium Dome failed due to numerous decision-making errors, as reported by the National Audit Office (NAO). The Dome cost taxpayers £28.7 million to maintain and sell over four years after its closure. A successful deal to convert it into a sports and entertainment venue has been reached, potentially returning over £550 million to the public sector. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott praised the new agreement, emphasizing its benefits for the local area and the progress made at the Millennium Village. However, Edward Leigh, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, criticized the first failed sale as a "complete fiasco," highlighting the confusion in government processes. NAO head Sir John Bourn acknowledged the hard work that led to the successful deal despite the initial setbacks.
