*CLASSIFICATION: left*

- The article promotes proposals for increased maternity pay and parental rights, which are generally associated with left-leaning policies that focus on social welfare.
- The language used by government officials, particularly the emphasis on benefits for new mothers and their families, aligns with progressive values.
- The criticisms from opposition parties do not detract from the overall support for increased maternity benefits, which underscores a pro-social welfare stance typical of leftist media bias.
