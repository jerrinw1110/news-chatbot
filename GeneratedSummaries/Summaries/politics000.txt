Michael Howard, leader of the Conservative Party, has introduced a plan aimed at reforming the UK's asylum system, advocating for strict immigration controls while asserting that these measures are not racist but necessary for fairness. The proposal includes an annual asylum limit, processing claims overseas, and withdrawing from the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees, which mandates acceptance of persecuted individuals based on their need rather than quotas. 

Critics, including Labour leader Tony Blair and Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor, argue that the Tory plan may jeopardize genuine refugees, with Blair asserting that reducing immigration staff could worsen issues rather than alleviate them. Taylor condemned the potential for genuine refugees to be turned away as "disgusting." 

Howard maintains that reforms will disrupt human trafficking operations and reduce immigration levels, which currently see nearly 160,000 people settling in the UK annually. The proposal also aims to stop in-country asylum applications, directing applicants to centers near their home countries instead.

While Howard argues that this strategy will improve community relations and the asylum process, concerns have been raised by organizations such as the UN Refugee Agency. They warn that this could convey a negative message to poorer nations hosting refugees. The Refugee Council has also labeled the plans as "dangerous and irresponsible." Despite the criticisms, Howard insists that discussions around race should not overshadow the need for fair immigration controls.
