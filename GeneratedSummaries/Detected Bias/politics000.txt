The article falls under the classification of "right" media bias. 

This classification is based on the content and perspective presented in the article. It reports on the Conservative Party's asylum reform plans, which focus on stringent immigration control measures and emphasizes a narrative of "fairness" in the asylum system despite potential risks for genuine refugees. The article presents Michael Howard's views and the Conservative perspective prominently, framing their immigration stance as necessary for national security and community integrity, which aligns with right-wing ideologies on immigration.

Additionally, the article mentions criticisms from the Labour Party and other organizations, but it ultimately portrays the Conservative plans in a way that suggests they are a responsible approach to immigration, uncomfortable with the criticisms levied against them. The language used by Michael Howard, such as asserting that the proposals are not racist and are meant to protect community relations, leans into a right-wing narrative that often aims to justify strict immigration policies. Overall, the article displays characteristics typical of right-leaning media, such as advocating for tougher immigration controls and prioritizing national security concerns.
